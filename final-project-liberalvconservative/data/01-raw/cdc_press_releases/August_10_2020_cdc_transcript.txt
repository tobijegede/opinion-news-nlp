In carrying out our respective missions, the U.S. Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are committed to protecting the health and safety of those we serve and employ. This is particularly important during the current COVID-19 health crisis.
Participation in 2020 Census interviews should present a low risk of transmission of COVID-19. Census takers are trained to rigorously and universally follow these CDC recommendations to mitigate risk of transmission:

Wearing of face masks.
Maintaining social distance of 6 ft. or more.
Practicing hand hygiene.
Not entering homes, and conducting interviews outside as much as possible or practical.

Household members encountered by census staff are encouraged to maintain social distances during interviews and practice the CDCâ€™s other recommendations as much as possible.
The CDC stands ready to support the work of the Census Bureau and its staff in providing consultation and technical assistance to ensure that relevant data and findings are communicated in a timely fashion to keep Census field staff and household members safe and healthy.
