Today, CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky, M.D., M.P.H., endorsed the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ (ACIP) recommendation for use of the Pfizer-BioNTech’s licensed vaccine for people 16 and older.
This recommendation follows FDA’s decision to fully approve Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine.
The ACIP recommendation comes 9 months after the committee’s interim recommendation and after an exhaustive review of the scientific evidence demonstrating safety and effectiveness, and supporting continued use of the vaccine.
“We now have a fully approved COVID-19 vaccine and ACIP has added its recommendation. If you have been waiting for this approval before getting the vaccine, now is the time to get vaccinated and join the more than 173 million Americans who are already fully vaccinated,” said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky.
