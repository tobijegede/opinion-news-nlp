      "TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Russian military invaded Ukraine last month, the most highly credentialed people in the world seemed stunned by it and that was not very reassuring to the rest of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quote: \"It was a shock to many of the leading experts and policymakers in the United States, Europe and even Ukraine,\" explained a fellow expert and policymaker at the Atlantic Council. Quote: \"The head of German intelligence was so caught off guard that he was still in Kyiv and had to be evacuated.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That's pretty weird if you think about it, because for weeks, Joe Biden had been speaking in a very loud voice about a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine. They seemed ready for it and yet it turns out that nobody in Washington, including Biden himself, really thought it was going to happen and when it did happen, official Washington concluded that Putin must be insane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The casual speculation about Vladimir Putin's mental state has become more serious,\" wrote \"National Review.\" In other words, there is a reason, a good reason none of us saw this coming. Putin just snapped. He is irrational and impossible to predict. A lot of people took that at face value, but you had to notice that, like most explanations you hear in Washington, it was self-exculpatory. It was more an excuse than an analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, Putin may well be crazy, but it's fair to assume there was more to the invasion of Ukraine than a single psychiatric episode and at this point, it would be nice to know exactly what it is, what happened and why. Why did the Russians do this?\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not treasonous to ask that. It's essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can't make wise decisions about the future without understanding what just happened. It's a prerequisite, but our leaders so far have refused to do that. They keep lying to themselves. They're imposing censorship on the rest of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "They're forcing the entire American population to mouth childish slogans about good versus evil. It's insulting, but worse, it's not helpful. This is not how nations survive complex moments like this. Crisis demands crystal clear thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now is the moment to ignore the people who have been consistently wrong and instead listen carefully to the people who've gotten it right in the past, the ones who saw the Ukraine war coming and said so out loud. Those are the people you should be listening to and one of them is Nigel Farage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody would call Farage a stooge of Vladimir Putin, just the opposite. Farage is a nationalist. He cares about his own country. He has devoted his life to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his case, his country is Great Britain, whose long-term interests have been gravely damaged by the Russian invasion and by the West's response to it. The same is true, unfortunately, of our country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. has never had a President as reckless as Joe Biden is. We're going to pay the price for that for a long time. But Nigel Farage, had you asked him, could have predicted all of this. In fact, he did predict it back in 2014 as the leader of the U.K. Independence Party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Farage gave a speech to the European Parliament that year, which unfortunately, we just saw yesterday. In retrospect, his words seemed prophetic. Farage understood what would happen because he saw clearly what had already taken place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Watch this carefully. We think you'll agree it's an analysis worth understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's Nigel Farage eight years ago on Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",

      "NIGEL FARAGE, THEN MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Amongst the long list of foreign policy failures and contradictions in the last few years, including, of course, the bombing of Libya, the desire to arm the rebels in Syria, has been the unnecessary provocation of Vladimir Putin.\n",
      "\n",
      "This E.U. Empire, ever seeking to expand, stated its territorial claim on the Ukraine some years ago. Just to make that worse, of course, some NATO members said they too would like the Ukraine to join NATO.\n",
      "\n",
      "We directly encouraged the uprising in the Ukraine that led to the toppling of the President, Yanukovych, and that led, of course, in turn to Vladimir Putin reacting and the moral of the story is if you poke the Russian bear with a stick, don't be surprised when he reacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, just to continue with that, today we are rushing through an association agreement at undue speed with the Ukraine and as we speak, there are NATO soldiers engaged in military exercises in the Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have we taken leave of our senses? Do we actually want to have a war with Putin because if we do, we're certainly going about it the right way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps we ought to recognize that the West now faces the biggest threat and crisis to our way of life that we have seen for over 70 years. The recent beheadings of the British and American hostages graphically illustrates the problem, and of course, we have our own citizens from our own countries engaged in that struggle, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the war against Islamic extremism, Vladimir Putin, whatever we may think of him as a human being, is actually on our side.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suggest we grow up. I suggest we recognize the real threat facing all of our countries, communities and societies; we stop playing war games in the Ukraine; and we start to prepare a plan to help countries like Syria, like Iraq, like Kenya, like indeed Nigeria, to try and help them to deal with the real threat that faces us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us not go on provoking Putin, whether we like him or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n",
      "\n",
      "CARLSON: Nigel Farage led the Brexit movement in the U.K., of course, we're happy to have him join us tonight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nigel Farage, thanks so much for coming on. So your concern for your own country, your nonaligned status is, you know, is the first line in your bio. You spent your entire life trying to defend your country, your country alone, so I don't think he was going to write you off as a tool of a foreign power.\n",
      "\n",
      "You said in that speech, which is shocking to watch now, if we want a war with Russia, why did you say that?\n",
      "\n",
      "FARAGE: Well, it was obvious to me? I mean, look, yes, you're absolutely right, Tucker, I'm a nationalist. I believe in my country. I fought for its independence. But I also believe in western values, and there are things that we, you know, you, America, Canada, Australia, many other countries, there is much that we share. And of course, you know, we joined together in two World Wars to fight for those values.\n",
      "\n",
      "We then lost our way completely, with Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and many other things. The globalists -- and I'm talking about Bill Clinton and Tony Blair who began it, and that then becomes an orthodoxy that NATO, the European Union, these empires should expand.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, you know, you need to understand Russia's history. The invasion by Napoleon, the invasion by Hitler, the deaths of tens of millions of Russians as a result of those invasions, and I could see that the westward expansion of NATO, of the European Union, after the fall of the Berlin Wall was a deliberately provocative act.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know, Churchill said, at the fall of the Nazi Empire, you know, be magnanimous in victory, don't rub their noses in the dirt as a result of what has been done, try to make sure that you can form an alliance and a lasting peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now look, I'll be honest with you, I am not a fan of Vladimir Putin in any way at all. You know, journalists like you -- journalists like you wouldn't survive long in Russia being critical of that of the regime.\n",
      "\n",
      "CARLSON: I agree with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "FARAGE: But on the big stuff, on the big values, understanding the threat that we face here, that you face there, from Islamic terrorism, from a Chinese Communist Party, we should have tried to make Vladimir Putin somebody we could do business with, not somebody we provoked, and we gave a Casus belli, a reason for war that he could sell to his own people.\n",
      "\n",
      "So look, I don't for one moment defend much of what Putin has done since the 24th of February, but understand that our huge geopolitical errors have led to much of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "CARLSON: Right. I mean, speaking for myself, I'm not interested in Russia or Putin. I don't listen to them. I don't believe them. I'm interested in the United States, you're interested in the United Kingdom. This seems bad for us. And it seems like when the smoke clears, China will run the world. That's my sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "FARAGE: Yes, I get that completely. And actually, you know, everything that's happened in the last month has driven Russia and China closer together. Can you imagine a worse scenario than this? And now we have an American President, the 46th American President who, and frankly, I can't believe there aren't more commentators calling for the 25th Amendment to be invoked.\n",
      "\n",
      "It goes and tells the 82nd Airborne, they are going into Ukraine, who backs Putin deeper into a corner. What we need right now is a peace settlement, and I think a peace settlement is achievable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, why? Why? Even after the date of the invasion where American and British and other NATO soldiers insisting they thought Ukraine should be able to join. We have lost sense of anything -- our predecessors, our leaders in generations that have gone before were much more intelligent than this. It's madness.\n",
      "\n",
      "CARLSON: Well, they cared about the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very quickly. One last question. You said that Empires expand always to the detriment of the country that sponsors them, right, the nation dies, the Empire grows. But can you see the United States or the U.K. getting anything out of, benefiting in any possible way from eastward expansion by the E.U. and NATO?\n",
      "\n",
      "FARAGE: Oh, yes, of course. Eisenhower, 70 years ago, identified the military industrial complex, it is still alive and well and there are big commercial interests that have benefited already from the expansion of NATO, politically, in terms of peace, in terms of culture into the nationhood. It's all been a massive, massive mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "CARLSON: Yes, Nigel Farage, I appreciate that. Those words were remarkable to see, eight years later. Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "FARAGE: Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "CARLSON: So just an update on a story we sort of have been following out of the corner of our eyes, so not that long ago, a future MSNBC anchor, then called Joy-Ann Reid wrote a blog called \"The Reid Report.\" And many people were saying that blog could be the origin of The Don't Say Gay movement, that blog attacks gay people, up one side and down the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "After in one rant, Reid herself wrote on that blog: \"Does that make me homophobic? Possibly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Reid claimed when confronted with this, that she didn't write the post, of course, standards have changed, so she runs away from her own writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "She told us in 2018 that she had been hacked and that cybersecurity experts would look into it. Do you remember this?\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "JOY REID, MSNBC HOST: A community that I support, and that I deeply care about is hurting because of some despicable and truly offensive posts being attributed to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now many of you have seen these blog posts circulating online and in social media, many of them are homophobic, discriminatory, and outright weird.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hired cybersecurity experts to see if somebody had manipulated my words or my former blog, and the reality is, they have not been able to prove it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here is what I know, I genuinely do not believe I wrote those hateful things because they are completely alien to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n",
      "\n",
      "CARLSON: So someone snuck onto her blog and attacked gay people. It couldn't have been her, she doesn't recognize those hateful things. Now, four years ago, we've been wondering, who could have done that? And of course now the answer is as obvious as vodka and pickled herring, it was Vladimir Putin. He must have hacked her blog and broke into the D.N.C.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that in mind, we launched a full investigation to Joy-Ann Reid's blog, and we will deliver the results of that investigation to you tomorrow. Stay tuned.\n",

      "CHRISTOPHER RUFO, SENIOR FELLOW, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: So this was an all- hands meeting in response to Governor DeSantis' legislation where Disney had assembled their LGBTQIA activists that they've set up within the company, and they said that they are deliberately trying to take programming that goes from even ages two to seven years old and inject queerness into that programming. They are trying to really make all of their programs this left-wing gender ideology compatible, and they are even doing something I think that is at the height of hypocrisy.\n",

      "At the same time, they are falsely accusing Governor DeSantis of implementing a Don't Say Gay Policy, which is not true at all. They were systematically and simultaneously telling all of their park employees to eliminate the words \"ladies, gentlemen, boys and girls.\" They're projecting onto the Governor what they themselves are doing. We've caught them on tape, and the evidence is damning.\n",

      "\n",
      "RUFO: That's right, and I think what we can really see inside the company is that executives made the decision a few years ago to create these activist organizations within the company, first on the issues of race and now, on the issues of gender and sexual orientation and these activist organizations essentially have taken moral power from within the company and the executives who are really cowardly and craven individuals, just cave anytime that they want something.\n",

I'm going to continue the important work that I do here in the Congress for my constituents.\n",

And they haven't and they've smeared your name, again, your private life, it is your business. Whether you committed a crime or not, it is everybody's business and you haven't, and I just want to ask you one more time crisply, and clearly, do you expect to be charged for the crimes of which they've accused?\n",

And each and every day, the lies about me unravel and are debunked. And the things I've said and admittedly, it's pretty wild to come on your show and say that my family is being shaken down for $25 million by some fraudsters, some with connections to the Intelligence Community and the Department of Justice. But in fact, someone has pled guilty to just that.\n",

If a law enforcement agency or the Justice Department accuses you of a crime, they have to prove it. They don't get to just shut you up by smearing you. They have to take it to a Court and show that you're guilty. And if they're not doing that they're not really a law enforcement agency.

      "For decades and decades, the Human Rights Campaign has been, by far, the most powerful gay rights lobby in Washington. You may have just heard of them recently, but they've been around for over 40 years, and for most of that time, HRC's central goal, and they said it many times, was winning the right of gay people to get legally married.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, in the summer of 2015, they finally succeeded. They reached their goal. The Supreme Court issued a decision in a case called Obergefell versus Hodges, and overnight, all 50 states were required by law to recognize same-sex marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for the Human Rights Campaign, this should have been a moment of unbridled celebration, a dream come true, but it wasn't. It was a crisis and if you don't understand why it was a crisis, then you don't live in Washington surrounded by non-profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, by this point, the Human Rights Campaign had evolved from a scrappy little lobby into a prominent arm of the Democratic Party. It had a huge annual budget, an enormous headquarters building right on 17th Street downtown.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the Human Rights Campaign may have outlived its reason for existing. On the other hand, it couldn't just disappear. There was a party to help, but there was a fundraising problem. Why would you give money to a group whose purpose has become obsolete? That was the dilemma and they're not the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Women's Christian Temperance Union faced the same problem after prohibition passed in 1919 and you don't hear a lot about the Women's Christian Temperance Union anymore. HRC desperately hoped to avoid that fate and here is the point of this story: Amazingly, through clever rebranding, they did avoid that fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in 2014, just before gay marriage became law, HRC's annual budget was about $57 million. That's a lot. Listen to this, by 2021 last year, that same budget had expanded to $65 million. In other words, seven years after reaching its stated goal, its reason for existing, the Human Rights Campaign was raising even more money, a lot more money.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's like magic. How did they do that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, they did it by changing their mission. So, immediately after the Supreme Court's decision on marriage, HRC began aggressively promoting the idea that the so-called transgender community was being gravely oppressed by American society, by you, and needed their help. In other words, all good people needed to send more money to HRC right away to help the transgender community.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the Human Rights Campaign's 2014 annual report, which we read today, barely mentions the word transgender. There is no reference at all of any kind to the idea that a person can change his sex just by wishing it so.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was during Barack Obama's second term, but even then, that seemed like a pretty farfetched claim, but not anymore. It's at the center of our national conversation and at the center of the Human Rights Campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their annual report this year promotes transgenderism on virtually every single page. There's a long write up on the organization's transgender justice initiative and a prominently displayed photograph of Joe Biden's latest admiral, Rachel Levine. So, the rebranding worked terrifically. HRC now raises millions and millions from companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, Goldman Sachs, Raytheon, Morgan Stanley, et cetera, every power center in the American economy, all of which fully support now the transgender project.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if you're wondering why the moment that same-sex marriage became legal in the United States, at that exact moment, your kid's teachers began to deny the reality of biological sex, now you know why. It was all part of a fundraising campaign from Washington.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you've ever felt you're caught in the middle of somebody else's fundraising campaign, guess what? You are. And as a result of that fundraising campaign, here's what elementary schools look like now.\n",

      "CARLSON: So, every emotionally marginal young woman with a nose ring now teaches at your kid's school. \"I teach my elementary school students about gender identity,\" said one on TikTok, of course. So how is a parent supposed to respond to this? We learned this weekend if someone tells an insulting joke about your wife, you're now allowed to smash them in the face and you get an award for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what are you allowed to do if some unionized teacher starts talking to your six-year-old about her genitals? Well, nothing is the answer, not one thing. You're not allowed to do anything. You have to sit back and allow that abuse to continue. Then you have to allow the medical establishment to profit from that abuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "On its website, to name one among many examples, St. Louis Children's Hospital now advertises for quote, \"puberty blockers, also called hormone blockers.\" These, it explains, can quote, \"help delay unwanted physical changes that don't match someone's gender identity. Delaying these changes can be an important step in a young person's transition.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, these changes are called biology. It is called puberty, which is naturally occurring. What happens when you stop it? Well, we don't know because there are no studies on it. Probably nothing good, and the short term answer to that, is definitely nothing good.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, this is not medical care. It is ghoulish experimentation on children being abetted by schools and cheered on by the Human Rights Campaign so it can raise more money.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Attorney General of Texas correctly calls all of this child abuse because of course, that's what it is, and he is launching an investigation into it and into hospitals that give children puberty blockers. Now, puberty blockers are not even, to be clear, F.D.A. approved for children who suffer from gender dysmorphia.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, why is this being allowed? Well, asking questions about it has outraged the monsters who prescribe life-altering drugs to children for profit. The CEO of Children's Hospital in Canada, for example, complained that what the state of Texas has done was a quote, \"ugly assault on the basic dignity of trans-youth and an obstacle to gender affirming care.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So, you notice what's going on here. Corporations have seized the language of the civil rights movement in order to sell more products. Too bad they didn't figure out this scam earlier. They'd be selling all kinds of products. Thalidomide would probably be on sale at your neighborhood pharmacy if they figured this out in the mid-60s, but they now have figured it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, this is the environment, an environment in which healthcare corporations are proudly performing ghoulish experiments on the reproductive systems of children, that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis just signed a bill, a defensive bill, really, it's called HB 1557, the Parental Rights in Education Bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "No matter what you have heard about this bill, it is a popular measure. Two-thirds of Americans support it. In Florida, the majority of Democratic Party primary voters, the most liberal voters in the State of Florida, support this bill -- 52 percent to 36 percent. That's why, as you would expect, HRC and its corporate allies in the media have lied about the bill and what it does. They have to because if they explained it, you'd support it.

      "\n",
      "For example, they support sexualizing kids in kindergarten. They support injecting woke gender ideology into second grade classrooms. They support enabling schools to quote \"transition students\" to a quote \"different gender without the knowledge of the parent, much less without the parent's consent.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "How is that not child abuse? If a stranger on the bus or in the park talked to your third-grader about her genitals that would be a crime, but it's not when the emotionally marginal chick with a nose ring does it in the classroom? Well, it is a crime and the bill in Florida specifically bans it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bill bans any classroom instruction on quote \"gender identity and sexual orientation in grades K through three\" kindergarten through third grade. That covers ages five through nine. In doing this, Florida has moved away from the experiments underway in many other places. In states like California, for example, the state's official policy declares that quote, \"Children as early as age two are expressing a different gender identity. It is strongly suggested that teachers privately ask transgender or gender- nonconforming students at the beginning of the school year how they want to be addressed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So that's lunacy, and what it does in effect is cut parents out of their children's childhood and hand parental powers to people who aren't even qualified to teach English or Math and they're certainly not qualified to counsel your child to change his or her sex and almost everybody understands that.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is lunacy. The Florida bill stops it and that's why Americans overwhelmingly support Florida's new bill.

      "So for instance, recently, he says that his greatest regret is not voting to impeach Donald Trump in 2019. Well, that year, he was publicly auditioning to join the administration as Trump's Secretary of the Navy.

      "Now, that job didn't pan out, and Kinzinger's team tells me that the implication that that family member couldn't get that job on her own is misogynistic, is garbage, but I think that that context goes a long way to explaining the deep personal antipathy that Kinzinger and Trump world have for each other at this point.\n",

      "\n",
      "We just got brand new information on what it is and the Pentagon's role in it. And by the way, what was Hunter Biden's role in funding these biolabs? We have new details from all of those threads from this single story, which seems like a pretty big story, honestly. That's straight ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n",
      "\n",
      "CARLSON: So for months now, we've been reading mentions on the internet of U.S. funded biolabs in Ukraine and we have not taken the bait. We did not do a single segment on this. We didn't even really follow up on the story. It seemed way too unlikely. The last thing we want to do is repeat information that's incorrect or traffic in legitimate conspiracy theories, and those are real actually.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we didn't do any story about that until the day that the Under Secretary of State, Toria Nuland, who is in charge of the war in Ukraine told a Senate Committee that actually there are U.S.-funded biolabs in Ukraine and what's in this biolabs is so dangerous, she is terrified it'll fall into Russian hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that got us asking in public, \"What?\" Why is the U.S. government funding some kind of biological research in Ukraine? What is it for? We were immediately shouted down. \"You can't ask that question.\" But we can because we're American citizens. It's our money. It's being done in our name, and so we would like to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Biden administration, of course, didn't answer. We found out from a separate source, the obvious, which is some of these are bio weapons, of course. Now, we know more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over this weekend, the show obtained a number of documents from a former high ranking US official that show the U.S. government through the Pentagon did in fact fund research into deadly pathogens in Ukraine. According to one of the documents, sometime between 2007 and 2008, quite some time ago, the Pentagon approved the development of a quote \"multi-pathogen mapping project\" to among other things, quote, \"take molecular fingerprinting of pathogens endemic to Ukraine and strain transfer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So it turns out what we reported all along was correct. The Pentagon is in fact researching pathogens in Ukraine. We're still not exactly sure on why, the explanations they've given us are ridiculous. We don't know how long this has been going on, but we know it dates back at least 14 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we reached out to the Pentagon to see why the DoD was researching pathogens, and if the research involved biological weapons, which we can tell you categorically it did. And they pointed us to a fact sheet that the Pentagon released almost three weeks ago that is filled with lies, and that lots of Pentagon reporters dutifully repeated as if it were true.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the factsheet tells us that since 2005, the Pentagon has spent $200 million in something called the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program in Ukraine. Now, that program supposedly is designed to dismantle Soviet era bio weapons.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait a second, how long does it take to dismantle Soviet era bio weapons? And in fact, if those are the only deadly pathogens in the labs, why would we be worried that the Russians could get them because they would already have them. None of it made any sense at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should tell you that in the Pentagon's response to us, they did not deny the existence of multi-pathogen mapping that was mentioned in the memo we retained nor did they refute the memos existence. We also got a set of documents from the Ukrainian government. That group of documents lists 30 biolabs in Ukraine that got funding from the U.S. Pentagon.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to these Ukrainian documents, these facilities use the funding for research and the collection storing of specimens. What's interesting is the Pentagon did not deny that it funded any of these facilities. In fact, the Pentagon's own factsheet says as many as 46 Ukrainian labs got funding from the United States. Forty-six labs? Really?\n",
      "\n",
      "We also learned a few days ago that the U.S. government was not only doing this, but other people were funding it as well, which is to say the research of some kind into deadly pathogens in Ukrainian labs. So we learned thanks to reporting from the \"National Pulse\" several days ago, that Hunter Biden's personal investment firm got money to researchers who are working on quote, \"isolating deadly pathogens\" in Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, \"The Daily Mail\" is reporting that e-mails in Hunter Biden's laptop confirm that that story is true. So again, we're not exactly sure what this means or where it goes. But ask yourself, in 2014-2015, did you realize that Joe Biden's son was helping fund some sort of research into deadly pathogens in Ukraine? Which is not exactly a hotbed of biomedical research. Why Ukraine? Why not Germany? Why not Japan? Why not a first world country?\n",

      "Josh, thanks so much for coming on. I'm sure you've been denounced for writing this news story. So thank you for doing it anyway. What did you learn?\n",
      "\n",
      "JOSH BOSWELL, SENIOR REPORTER, \"THE DAILY MAIL\": Well, first off, I want to make clear that the Russian government is clearly pushing a propaganda line to try and justify their war in Ukraine. Right? They're saying that the American government was working on bio weapons in Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not have evidence of that specifically, but I do have a lot of other very interesting evidence, which we should be asking a lot of questions about.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what do we know right now? Well, we know as you said that the U.S. was funding these biolabs in Ukraine that they were looking at deadly pathogens. We know that Hunter Biden was helping raise money for funding, one of the companies involved in that called Metabiota.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we also know from my reporting, e-mails from Hunter Biden's laptop, that not only was he involved in funding that company, but he was also involved in getting that company into Ukraine, getting it deals that it needed to be done, to do the work he was trying to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for example, there are meetings that he had with executives from Metabiota, and it is really interesting the way that the executives speak in those e-mails. They say that they wanted to help assert Ukraine's cultural and economic independence from Russia, which I found kind of odd for a company that is supposed to just be monitoring disease data, pandemic data. Why are they trying to also assert Ukraine's independence?\n",
      "\n",
      "And there's also a quote-unquote \"science project\" that Hunter and his business partners pitched to the Ukrainian gas firm, Burisma, allegedly a corrupt firm, and that he was working with at the time, and this science project involves getting Metabiota some kind of deal in Ukraine and maybe using Burisma's high level government contacts in Ukraine to get that done.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also know that the funding that Metabiota received totaled $18.4 million from the Department of Defense, a small portion of that, $307,000.00 goes to quote, \"Ukraine research projects,\" according to DoD records and government funding records.\n",
      "\n",
      "So there's a lot of questions here. Why was Hunter involved in this? Especially at a time, 2014, when his father Joe Biden, the Vice President then was in charge of foreign policy towards Ukraine for the U.S. It's surely at least a conflict of interest there.\n",
      "\n",
      "CARLSON: Well, it's so unbelievably corrupt. I could care less what the government says of Russia, about anything. I don't believe the government of Russia, I care about the government of the United States, which I help pay for.\n",
      "\n",
      "So these are fair questions, I'm grateful that you unearthed them, and I hope you'll keep going, Josh Boswell of \"Daily Mail.\" Thank you.\n",

      "Now, like Ketanji Jackson, Cory Booker is also a world-famous legal scholar, hence his seat on the Judiciary Committee. Booker attended not only Stanford and Yale Law School, but then went all the way to Oxford University in England on the coveted Rhodes Scholarship. He has quite a resume.\n",

      "\n",
      "Cory Booker is from a world you have never been to. He's from a hard, unforgiving world of crime, decay, and raw urban authenticity. Cory Booker is from the streets of Newark. He once described his world in an interview, quote: \"I still remember my first month on the street,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I walked up to this charismatic Black guy my age called T-Bone, who was one of the drug lords. I said, 'Yo, man, what's up?' And he leaped up and for me, looked me right in the eye and said, 'Who the blank do you think you are? If you ever so much as, look at me again, I'm going to put a cap in your ass.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, T-Bone, as you probably concluded, was one of Newark's most notorious drug lords. As Joe Biden might have said, he was a bad dude. But Cory Booker is a bad dude, too, in his own way and the two became close. The Rhodes Scholar and the crack slinger, united by a common love of the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then inevitably, tragedy struck. Cory Booker learned that T-Bone was on the lam from the law. By this point, Cory Booker was the mayor of Newark, so the friendship couldn't last. As Booker later recalled with sadness, quote \" ... that rift between me and T-Bone was inches. We sat there, but I felt so alienated that there was a gulf as wide as the Grand Canyon between us and I could not reach out to save this young man, and we drove back to a housing project called Brick Towers, and I've never seen him again since that day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a poignant story, but Cory Booker isn't alone. No one has seen T-Bone since that day. In fact, no one has ever seen T-Bone at any point ever because T-Bone doesn't exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we later learned, T-Bone is a fictional character. Cory Booker made him up entirely, but Cory Booker didn't stop there. He also invented his own identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "It turns out that Cory Booker is not a product of the streets of Newark, not even close. He is, in fact, a blue-eyed rich kid from an all-White suburb. His parents were IBM executives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now you can judge, but you have to concede that whatever else he is, Cory Booker is a remarkable actor. He is the Jussie Smollett of Democratic politics. A fraud? Yes, but a deeply committed one, a man who has honed his skills and those skills have been on full display this week as Booker has emoted all over Ketanji Jackson.\n",

That seemed like a fair question, maybe an important question.\n",
      "\n",
      "For asking it, we were immediately denounced by so-called reporters as disloyal agents of Vladimir Putin. They accused us of repeating discredited Russian disinformation about the existence of bio weapons in Ukraine.

But the experience did get us thinking, what is the truth here? Why exactly are we paying for biolabs in Ukraine of all places? How long has this been going on? And what's the purpose of it?\n",
      "\n",
      "So we started poking around to find out, we did. We just spoke to someone who knows the answer to this question, someone with direct firsthand knowledge of this topic. It turns out that our government has for some time funded biolabs in Ukraine that do among other things, research on yes, biological weapons.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not a conspiracy theory. It's true.\n",
      "\n",
      "So why is the U.S. government doing this in Ukraine? The answer because no one wants to do bioweapons research in this country. It's too dangerous, and it's too unpopular.\n",
      "\n",
      "For decades, the U.S. government worked on bio weapons at places like Fort Dietrich in suburban Maryland underground at the Army's Dugway Proving Ground outside Salt Lake City. But after a series of accidents and controversies, the government decided to move bioweapons research offshore, Ukraine, among other countries was a perfect place to relocate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because Ukraine is not a democracy, the Ukrainian government can host all the bioweapons research it wants. There is nothing ordinary Ukrainians can do about it. That's the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, we're not shocked that our government is lying about this, a bioweapons program is by definition a National Security matter. So you do not expect full transparency. That's okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we're shocked by is the Biden administration's willingness to attack anyone who presses them for answers as an agent of a hostile foreign power. Get out of our way or will accuse you of treason. That's over the top. That's their MO, not just the White House, but the toadies in the press corps who do their bidding, denouncing American citizens as disloyal for telling the truth. No wonder so many elected Republicans obey them, they're afraid not to.\n",

      "But there is more to the story. How much more? We're not sure. But the National Pulse is reporting tonight, that apparently a private equity firm run by Hunter Biden funded some of the research into pathogens in these biolabs.\n",

      "What are the outlines of that story? We're not sure. But we know it's legitimate to ask what it means. Why wouldn't it be? You're not a Russian agent, repeating discredited Putin talking points if you ask.\n",

They buy them from dispensaries.\n",

Well, first of all, there was a study out of Colorado in 2018, that 70 percent of the dispensaries are telling pregnant women it is okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's look at the science behind this. Mount Sinai just put out a big study this year in the \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\" that showed that pregnant women that were smoking pot to ease their anxiety, ease their anxiety, guess what happened? Their children when they were born, had more anxiety, had anger issues, had ADHD.\n",

      "Also, five million live births in California were studied over the last several years, and you know what? Those five million live births to women, that smoked pot, those five million children to women who smoked pot during pregnancy had behavioral issues. They were born smaller, they had other health problems occurring.\n",

I am pretty libertarian on most things, not against tobacco, for example, but most people think pregnant women shouldn't smoke, so, why is it so unfashionable to say pregnant women probably shouldn't use weed either? I mean, I don't know why that is such a crazy thing to say, but you're not allowed to say it. Glad you did, Marc Siegel.\n",

Now, he is 82 and he plays golf and tennis again at 82 years old.\n",

The Army has now proven in a three-year study, it is 85 percent effective, a single injection, they've got PTSD, I know what to do with that. I've had people I've turned around, I took a guy on CNN that was just -- he couldn't see, wearing dark glasses is shaking, the whole nine yards, turned around, but it takes three hours and about 32 veterans kill himself every day.\n",

So they think it will get approved the end of this year, beginning next year, but even osteoarthritis, it's a single injection, it stimulates your stem cells to create all new tendons in your body and the tendons are like 16 year old tendons even if you're 40, 50, 60 years old, so it's -- again, it's phase three.

What did that line mean?\n",

Effectively what she argued in response to Senator Hawley is this, Tucker, child pornography laws are too strict for child pornographers. They deserve the benefit of technology so that they don't have to go to prison as long as everyone was suggesting that they should have in the 1980s and the 1990s. This is her reasoned legal judgment.\n",

This makes no sense.\n",

      "\n",
      "The children pictured were eight years old, Tucker. Do you believe that an 18-year-old has very much in common with an eight-year-old in terms of their one being an adult, the other being in the third grade? These are not similar people?\n",

      "CARLSON: So you get appointed to look into the election. What did you expect to find?\n",
      "\n",
      "MICHAEL GABLEMAN, WISCONSIN SPECIAL COUNSEL: I expected to find a heavy influence of Zuckerberg money that came into Wisconsin and affected our elections, especially in our five biggest cities in the state -- Milwaukee, Madison, Green Bay, Kenosha, and Racine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I expected that there would be influence, but I've been shocked at how deeply and this is their word, \"embedded\" the private Zuckerberg agents or employees came in actually administering the elections in those cities to one degree or another.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cities -- in some cities, they took over the election. Green Bay as an example, Mayor Eric Genrich, rolled out the welcome mat and facilitated the takeover of a public election by private partisan interest groups, who were set in motion by Mark Zuckerberg and guided by the political goals of David Plouffe, one of the two top political advisers to Barack Obama, who wrote the book \"Citizens Guide to Defeating Donald Trump\" and David Plouffe wrote \"The New York Times\" a few days after Donald Trump won the presidency.\n",
      "\n",
      "November 11, 2016, David Plouffe wrote a letter to \"The New York Times\" and he said the reason that Hillary Clinton lost is because she didn't spend enough time in states like Wisconsin, and she didn't do enough to turn out the African-American vote because the research shows us that African- Americans tend to vote about 86 percent Democrat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, David Plouffe was a man on a mission and he wasn't about to let that mistake happen when it came to fulfilling his dream of beating Donald Trump, and he then was the midwife for $330 million of Mark Zuckerberg's money, and David Plouffe took that money, and he delivered it to this entity called CTCL, Center for Tech and Civic Life staffed with people who literally, within a few weeks of taking a hand in administering elections in Wisconsin, taking over the public task, the public role of administering public elections, the leader of this Center for Tech and Civic Life, had just finished her two-year Obama fellowship.\n",

      "\n",
      "Now Poland is a NATO ally. Of course, it shares a frontier with Ukraine and several weeks ago, Michael Tracey, one of the last honest journalists in this country decided to go there to find out exactly what's happening.\n",
      "\n",
      "So when he arrived, a U.S. soldier at one base told Tracey there was, quote, \"a media blackout on all American military activity in Poland.\" Really? Why can't we know? Is there a good reason? So we reached out to the Pentagon, they told us this, quote: \"We provided media coverage of troops assigned to Europe. That said, we are not embedding journalists the way we did in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we are not providing extended media access.\" In other words, \"Buzz off, you have no right to know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Michael Tracey is there. And so we thought we would check in with him tonight. He of course, writes on \"Substack.\" And we're happy to see him. So Michael Tracey, I should just say, you don't even need to respond, but to frame this, you've been coming on the show for at least five years to talk about Russia, you've kind of followed that story, all the way with a logical conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are you seeing in Poland that we're not hearing about here?\n",
      "\n",
      "MICHAEL TRACEY, INDEPENDENT JOURNALIST: Well, think about what the Pentagon apparently just told you today. They're not even allowing handpicked reporters, the reporters who would be disposed to have a favorable impression of what the U.S. military is doing in Poland to come view what the government representatives, you know that what the taxpayers' representatives are doing in close proximity to a Hot War zone.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what they're doing, ultimately, is directly fueling a proxy war against Russia. You know, on this very network a couple of days ago, Ben Sasse, who is this Republican senator that we are told is some sort of a moderate, because I think he objected to the phrasing of some Donald Trump tweets a couple of years ago, he was braying that the U.S. policy must be to facilitate the ability of Ukrainians to \"kill Russians,\" quote-unquote, \"kill Russians.\" And that's the essence of a proxy war, and that is what Poland is enabling the facilitation of by way of the massive number of U.S. troops now that have been deployed to this country.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so if that's the nature of the commitment that Americans now have, in this major war, you'd expect some measure, perhaps, of transparency allowed, so we can understand as citizens what our government is doing, and instead, there's a shroud of secrecy around these operations, you know, that journalists are not allowed to take any kind of look at what the military is doing here.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a congressional delegation to Poland over the weekend by a bipartisan delegation, Members of the House of Representatives, and I inquired with both Republicans and Democrats on this trip, Members of Congress to just get basic information on what they were doing, an itinerary, a scheduled something.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what I was told was that they couldn't provide those details to journalists because of quote-unquote \"security reasons.\" But what are those security reasons? Is America at war? Is Poland at war? Not apparently. And yet, you know, there is such little insight that is allowed to be given as to what our government is doing here that that secrecy alone should trouble everyone, I would think, at least, if you're disinclined to favor the escalation of this conflict into some kind of Hot War involving the U.S. that could potentially eventuate a World War Three.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, you know, before a couple of weeks ago, World War Three was not something that most people were willing to entertain and now, it is just kind of floated out there as something that could be inevitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "CARLSON: I think in a democracy, you are allowed to know what your government is doing in your name, whether you support it or not, and as you point out, we don't know and I appreciate your reporting, Michael Tracey from Poland. Thank you.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "CANDACE OWENS, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I mean, I also sent them even more links. I mean, that was just one link that I sent them, but there is ten to twenty links between \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times\" over the last three or four years telling us about how unyielding the corruption is and really spelling out to us how corrupt President Zelenskyy is, but they've magically changed their mind. So, I was confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe Russian disinformation means now for \"The New York Times\" truth, given the Hunter Biden laptop scenario, which they called Russian disinformation and they now acknowledge is fully true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, he responded and said, \"Thank you for sending these links.\" And then completely move the goalpost and asked me whether or not I accepted the official government narrative regarding bio labs and whether they were just opened for research. And I said, this is completely nonsensical. What does this have to do with your initial question?\n",
      "\n",
      "And then I sent him another link. And I said, is that the official government narrative regarding bio labs? Is it for research? Because you guys also told me in another article that they were funding these labs to shut down previous Soviet labs?\n",
      "\n",
      "And then he just said, \"Thank you for your time. No more questions.\" Because I don't think he's reading \"The New York Times\" and doesn't realize how many times they pivot the narrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "And here is the thing. Nobody believes this Russian puppet stuff. I mean, it's just ridiculous. A Black woman in the United States have never even been to Russia. I mean, I can't think of a Russian food off the top of my head. I mean, it's so ridiculous. I refuse to give it any air.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they say these things when you arrive at a truth that they don't want them looking at, that they don't want the public at large looking at. They say: Oh, look over here, never mind this person is a Russian puppet, exactly like they did with the Hunter Biden laptop until they were ready to acknowledge the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I really tried to reflect on what it was that I was hitting at that was bothering them, and really, it was me talking about Zelenskyy. You know, Zelenskyy right now, according to the mainstream narrative, the new mainstream narrative, I should say, is Batman, right? We're all supposed to just go: He's an amazing hero, and he's not corrupt.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I've been talking about their previous covering of him in the Pandora Papers talking about his ties to, you know, Ukrainian billionaires that are -- that all have a controlling interest in Burisma. That might be a significant conversation for the press to have in a moment when we have Biden's administration egging us on, trying to get us more involved in this conflict in Ukraine and they don't want that conversation to be had.\n",
      "\n",
      "So instead, they're going with a Black female from the United States is somehow on Putin's payroll, which is just pointedly ridiculous.\n",
      "\n",
      "CARLSON: Oh, I know the feeling. Russian disinformation.\n",

      "\n",
      "Sohrab Ahmari, thanks so much for coming on. There was never even a pause to apologize for the last thing they broke, and now they want to hurt our country even more. Why is no one saying, \"Stop, Stop\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "SOHRAB AHMARI, PUBLISHER, COMPACT.COM: Yes, Tucker, I'm getting that weird 2003 deja vu feeling. I remember and you remember, when the whole nation and the whole West was being goaded into what turned out to be a really stupid war that killed thousands of Americans, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, and ultimately, the outcome was what? Utter waste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Except this time the war that they're agitating for is not against this little Podunk, vicious Arab kleptocracy, like Saddam Hussein's, it's against a nuclear armed Eurasian civilization with one of the largest arsenals of strategic weapons on Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "So how is that? How is that happening? It's very puzzling and it is very disturbing. And I think Americans should have this sense that we've been down this road before, maybe we should press our elected leaders of both parties because it's really a uniparty for war to take a different path.\n",
      "\n",
      "CARLSON: Well, and if we're going to have a war with Russia, which we effectively already do, shouldn't we get new people to run it? Why would you keep hiring the same -- why would Liz Cheney have another shot at this? Like she has never done anything that has helped our country? So why would she be in charge of the next iteration? I don't understand that.\n",
      "\n",
      "AHMARI: Yes, so absolutely right. Liz Cheney is the kind of more visible face of it, but there are also people who are inside government who are less visible like current Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, who is the subject of my piece. Her career is proof that there is such a thing as a pro war uniparty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Victoria Nuland started her career in the Clinton administration working under Strobe Talbott, then worked as an aide to Vice President Dick Cheney in the Iraq War years, then worked as Ambassador to NATO in the later Bush years, then went as into the State Department under Obama, where she was, in part, part of the Benghazi debacle, skipped the Trump administration, but now is back under Biden.\n",

I've got some mild cold symptoms, but I'm feeling fine.\" Now can you guess what Hillary wrote next? Now, keep in mind, this is the most conventional person in human history, so she wrote the most conventional possible thing.
