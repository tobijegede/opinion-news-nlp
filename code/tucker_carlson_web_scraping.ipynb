      "['TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.\\n\\nWhen the Russian military invaded Ukraine last month, the most highly credentialed people in the world seemed stunned by it and that was not very reassuring to the rest of us.\\n\\nQuote: \"It was a shock to many of the leading experts and policymakers in the United States, Europe and even Ukraine,\" explained a fellow expert and policymaker at the Atlantic Council. Quote: \"The head of German intelligence was so caught off guard that he was still in Kyiv and had to be evacuated.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s pretty weird if you think about it, because for weeks, Joe Biden had been speaking in a very loud voice about a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine. They seemed ready for it and yet it turns out that nobody in Washington, including Biden himself, really thought it was going to happen and when it did happen, official Washington concluded that Putin must be insane.\\n\\n\"The casual speculation about Vladimir Putin\\'s mental state has become more serious,\" wrote \"National Review.\" In other words, there is a reason, a good reason none of us saw this coming. Putin just snapped. He is irrational and impossible to predict. A lot of people took that at face value, but you had to notice that, like most explanations you hear in Washington, it was self-exculpatory. It was more an excuse than an analysis.\\n\\nIn fact, Putin may well be crazy, but it\\'s fair to assume there was more to the invasion of Ukraine than a single psychiatric episode and at this point, it would be nice to know exactly what it is, what happened and why. Why did the Russians do this?\\n\\nIt\\'s not treasonous to ask that. It\\'s essential.\\n\\nYou can\\'t make wise decisions about the future without understanding what just happened. It\\'s a prerequisite, but our leaders so far have refused to do that. They keep lying to themselves. They\\'re imposing censorship on the rest of us.\\n\\nThey\\'re forcing the entire American population to mouth childish slogans about good versus evil. It\\'s insulting, but worse, it\\'s not helpful. This is not how nations survive complex moments like this. Crisis demands crystal clear thinking.\\n\\nSo now is the moment to ignore the people who have been consistently wrong and instead listen carefully to the people who\\'ve gotten it right in the past, the ones who saw the Ukraine war coming and said so out loud. Those are the people you should be listening to and one of them is Nigel Farage.\\n\\nNobody would call Farage a stooge of Vladimir Putin, just the opposite. Farage is a nationalist. He cares about his own country. He has devoted his life to it.\\n\\nIn his case, his country is Great Britain, whose long-term interests have been gravely damaged by the Russian invasion and by the West\\'s response to it. The same is true, unfortunately, of our country.\\n\\nThe U.S. has never had a President as reckless as Joe Biden is. We\\'re going to pay the price for that for a long time. But Nigel Farage, had you asked him, could have predicted all of this. In fact, he did predict it back in 2014 as the leader of the U.K. Independence Party.\\n\\nFarage gave a speech to the European Parliament that year, which unfortunately, we just saw yesterday. In retrospect, his words seemed prophetic. Farage understood what would happen because he saw clearly what had already taken place.\\n\\nWatch this carefully. We think you\\'ll agree it\\'s an analysis worth understanding.\\n\\nHere\\'s Nigel Farage eight years ago on Ukraine.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nNIGEL FARAGE, THEN MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Amongst the long list of foreign policy failures and contradictions in the last few years, including, of course, the bombing of Libya, the desire to arm the rebels in Syria, has been the unnecessary provocation of Vladimir Putin.\\n\\nThis E.U. Empire, ever seeking to expand, stated its territorial claim on the Ukraine some years ago. Just to make that worse, of course, some NATO members said they too would like the Ukraine to join NATO.\\n\\nWe directly encouraged the uprising in the Ukraine that led to the toppling of the President, Yanukovych, and that led, of course, in turn to Vladimir Putin reacting and the moral of the story is if you poke the Russian bear with a stick, don\\'t be surprised when he reacts.\\n\\nNow, just to continue with that, today we are rushing through an association agreement at undue speed with the Ukraine and as we speak, there are NATO soldiers engaged in military exercises in the Ukraine.\\n\\nHave we taken leave of our senses? Do we actually want to have a war with Putin because if we do, we\\'re certainly going about it the right way.\\n\\nPerhaps we ought to recognize that the West now faces the biggest threat and crisis to our way of life that we have seen for over 70 years. The recent beheadings of the British and American hostages graphically illustrates the problem, and of course, we have our own citizens from our own countries engaged in that struggle, too.\\n\\nIn the war against Islamic extremism, Vladimir Putin, whatever we may think of him as a human being, is actually on our side.\\n\\nI suggest we grow up. I suggest we recognize the real threat facing all of our countries, communities and societies; we stop playing war games in the Ukraine; and we start to prepare a plan to help countries like Syria, like Iraq, like Kenya, like indeed Nigeria, to try and help them to deal with the real threat that faces us.\\n\\nLet us not go on provoking Putin, whether we like him or not.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: Nigel Farage led the Brexit movement in the U.K., of course, we\\'re happy to have him join us tonight.\\n\\nNigel Farage, thanks so much for coming on. So your concern for your own country, your nonaligned status is, you know, is the first line in your bio. You spent your entire life trying to defend your country, your country alone, so I don\\'t think he was going to write you off as a tool of a foreign power.\\n\\nYou said in that speech, which is shocking to watch now, if we want a war with Russia, why did you say that?\\n\\nFARAGE: Well, it was obvious to me? I mean, look, yes, you\\'re absolutely right, Tucker, I\\'m a nationalist. I believe in my country. I fought for its independence. But I also believe in western values, and there are things that we, you know, you, America, Canada, Australia, many other countries, there is much that we share. And of course, you know, we joined together in two World Wars to fight for those values.\\n\\nWe then lost our way completely, with Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and many other things. The globalists -- and I\\'m talking about Bill Clinton and Tony Blair who began it, and that then becomes an orthodoxy that NATO, the European Union, these empires should expand.\\n\\nAnd, you know, you need to understand Russia\\'s history. The invasion by Napoleon, the invasion by Hitler, the deaths of tens of millions of Russians as a result of those invasions, and I could see that the westward expansion of NATO, of the European Union, after the fall of the Berlin Wall was a deliberately provocative act.\\n\\nYou know, Churchill said, at the fall of the Nazi Empire, you know, be magnanimous in victory, don\\'t rub their noses in the dirt as a result of what has been done, try to make sure that you can form an alliance and a lasting peace.\\n\\nNow look, I\\'ll be honest with you, I am not a fan of Vladimir Putin in any way at all. You know, journalists like you -- journalists like you wouldn\\'t survive long in Russia being critical of that of the regime.\\n\\nCARLSON: I agree with that.\\n\\nFARAGE: But on the big stuff, on the big values, understanding the threat that we face here, that you face there, from Islamic terrorism, from a Chinese Communist Party, we should have tried to make Vladimir Putin somebody we could do business with, not somebody we provoked, and we gave a Casus belli, a reason for war that he could sell to his own people.\\n\\nSo look, I don\\'t for one moment defend much of what Putin has done since the 24th of February, but understand that our huge geopolitical errors have led to much of it.\\n\\nCARLSON: Right. I mean, speaking for myself, I\\'m not interested in Russia or Putin. I don\\'t listen to them. I don\\'t believe them. I\\'m interested in the United States, you\\'re interested in the United Kingdom. This seems bad for us. And it seems like when the smoke clears, China will run the world. That\\'s my sense.\\n\\nFARAGE: Yes, I get that completely. And actually, you know, everything that\\'s happened in the last month has driven Russia and China closer together. Can you imagine a worse scenario than this? And now we have an American President, the 46th American President who, and frankly, I can\\'t believe there aren\\'t more commentators calling for the 25th Amendment to be invoked.\\n\\nIt goes and tells the 82nd Airborne, they are going into Ukraine, who backs Putin deeper into a corner. What we need right now is a peace settlement, and I think a peace settlement is achievable.\\n\\nI mean, why? Why? Even after the date of the invasion where American and British and other NATO soldiers insisting they thought Ukraine should be able to join. We have lost sense of anything -- our predecessors, our leaders in generations that have gone before were much more intelligent than this. It\\'s madness.\\n\\nCARLSON: Well, they cared about the country.\\n\\nVery quickly. One last question. You said that Empires expand always to the detriment of the country that sponsors them, right, the nation dies, the Empire grows. But can you see the United States or the U.K. getting anything out of, benefiting in any possible way from eastward expansion by the E.U. and NATO?\\n\\nFARAGE: Oh, yes, of course. Eisenhower, 70 years ago, identified the military industrial complex, it is still alive and well and there are big commercial interests that have benefited already from the expansion of NATO, politically, in terms of peace, in terms of culture into the nationhood. It\\'s all been a massive, massive mistake.\\n\\nCARLSON: Yes, Nigel Farage, I appreciate that. Those words were remarkable to see, eight years later. Thank you.\\n\\nFARAGE: Thank you.\\n\\nCARLSON: So just an update on a story we sort of have been following out of the corner of our eyes, so not that long ago, a future MSNBC anchor, then called Joy-Ann Reid wrote a blog called \"The Reid Report.\" And many people were saying that blog could be the origin of The Don\\'t Say Gay movement, that blog attacks gay people, up one side and down the other.\\n\\nAfter in one rant, Reid herself wrote on that blog: \"Does that make me homophobic? Possibly.\\n\\nNow, Reid claimed when confronted with this, that she didn\\'t write the post, of course, standards have changed, so she runs away from her own writing.\\n\\nShe told us in 2018 that she had been hacked and that cybersecurity experts would look into it. Do you remember this?\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nJOY REID, MSNBC HOST: A community that I support, and that I deeply care about is hurting because of some despicable and truly offensive posts being attributed to me.\\n\\nNow many of you have seen these blog posts circulating online and in social media, many of them are homophobic, discriminatory, and outright weird.\\n\\nI hired cybersecurity experts to see if somebody had manipulated my words or my former blog, and the reality is, they have not been able to prove it.\\n\\nBut here is what I know, I genuinely do not believe I wrote those hateful things because they are completely alien to me.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: So someone snuck onto her blog and attacked gay people. It couldn\\'t have been her, she doesn\\'t recognize those hateful things. Now, four years ago, we\\'ve been wondering, who could have done that? And of course now the answer is as obvious as vodka and pickled herring, it was Vladimir Putin. He must have hacked her blog and broke into the D.N.C.\\n\\nWith that in mind, we launched a full investigation to Joy-Ann Reid\\'s blog, and we will deliver the results of that investigation to you tomorrow. Stay tuned.\\n\\nSo Disney used to be in the business of entertaining children. Now, there is something much darker going on at Disney that you might want to protect your children from.\\n\\nWe\\'ve got leaked internal video from the company, explaining how they are trying to sexualize your underage children. Is that a crime? It seems like it.\\n\\nAnd then Bruce Willis just made an announcement about the future of his career after a very sad diagnosis. We\\'ll explain what it is with Dr. Siegel.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nCARLSON: The Governor of Florida has signed a bill banning teachers from talking to small children ages kindergarten through third grade about their own genitals or encouraging them to change their gender. The overwhelming majority -- overwhelming majority of Americans including of Democrats agree with that because it\\'s commonsense and the alternative is disgusting and probably illegal.\\n\\nBut at the Walt Disney Corporation, they were infuriated by this. Disney called an all-hands meeting to discuss new ways to indoctrinate children without their parents\\' knowledge.\\n\\nChris Rufo obtained footage from that meeting. Here is the executive producer of Disney Television Animation bragging about quote \"injecting queerness into as many shows as she can.\"\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nMEREDITH ROBERTS, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF DISNEY TELEVISION ANIMATION: Our leadership over there has been so welcoming to like my like not-at-all secret gay agenda.\\n\\nI don\\'t have to be afraid to like let\\'s have these two characters kiss, let\\'s, in the background like, I was just -- wherever I could just basically adding queerness to like. If you see anything queer in the show - - I just was like, no one would stop me and no one was trying to stop me.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: Okay, so here is Disney\\'s Diversity and Inclusion Manager explain that the company will no longer use the words \"boys and girls.\" Watch.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nDISNEY\\'S DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION MANAGER: Last summer, we removed all of the gender gradients in relationship to our live spiels. So we no longer say \"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.\" We we\\'ve trained -- we\\'ve provided training for all of our cast members in relationship to that so now they know it\\'s, \"Hello everyone\" or \"Hello friends.\"\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: De-gendering your children without telling you. Chris Rufo is a journalist and a filmmaker and quite a reporter, he got this footage as he has done many times in the past on related topics. We\\'re happy to have him join us tonight.\\n\\nChris, thanks a lot for coming on. So, what exactly was that?\\n\\nCHRISTOPHER RUFO, SENIOR FELLOW, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: So this was an all- hands meeting in response to Governor DeSantis\\' legislation where Disney had assembled their LGBTQIA activists that they\\'ve set up within the company, and they said that they are deliberately trying to take programming that goes from even ages two to seven years old and inject queerness into that programming. They are trying to really make all of their programs this left-wing gender ideology compatible, and they are even doing something I think that is at the height of hypocrisy.\\n\\nAt the same time, they are falsely accusing Governor DeSantis of implementing a Don\\'t Say Gay Policy, which is not true at all. They were systematically and simultaneously telling all of their park employees to eliminate the words \"ladies, gentlemen, boys and girls.\" They\\'re projecting onto the Governor what they themselves are doing. We\\'ve caught them on tape, and the evidence is damning.\\n\\nCARLSON: Should they have a sexual agenda for six-year-old children. So right there, you think, well, you know, you\\'d think that\\'s illegal in some way. It is certainly immoral. It\\'s creepy as hell. And yet, you know, and they are the country\\'s leading purveyor of children\\'s programming. That\\'s a problem. No?\\n\\nRUFO: That\\'s right, and I think what we can really see inside the company is that executives made the decision a few years ago to create these activist organizations within the company, first on the issues of race and now, on the issues of gender and sexual orientation and these activist organizations essentially have taken moral power from within the company and the executives who are really cowardly and craven individuals, just cave anytime that they want something.\\n\\nAnd so all of these videos document that whatever these activists say, they are now creating a tracking program for all Disney children\\'s content to find out exactly how many transgender, asexual, and bisexual characters that they are peppering into the show either in the foreground or the background.\\n\\nIt sounds like a really kind of bizarre and creepy gender studies experiment on a college campus, but it is being mainlined into children\\'s programming all over the world.\\n\\nCARLSON: Well, it sounds like the behavior of a sex offender. I mean, normal people don\\'t sexualize underage children. Period. They have nothing to do with sex. They\\'re little kids. They\\'re prepubescent, but Disney doesn\\'t feel that way. It seems like a threat, and I appreciate your exposing it. Chris Rufo, thank you.\\n\\nRUFO: Thank you.\\n\\nCARLSON: So actor Bruce Willis became worldwide famous in 1988 with the first \"Die Hard\" movie. There is one scene you may remember.\\n\\n[VIDEO CLIP OF \"DIE HARD\" PLAYS.]\\n\\nHANS GRUBER, FICTIONAL CHARACTER: I thought I told all of you, I want radio silence until --\\n\\nJOHN MCCLANE, FICTIONAL CHARACTER: I\\'m very sorry, Hans. I didn\\'t get that message.\\n\\nMaybe you should have put it on a bulletin board.\\n\\nGRUBER: Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?\\n\\nMCCLANE: Yippee-Ki-Yay, mother [bleep].\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: So today Bruce Willis\\' family announced he is retiring from acting and from work due to something called aphasia. Given that Bruce Willis has been part of American culture for so long, we thought it\\'d be worth finding out what aphasia is and what it means.\\n\\nDr. Marc Siegel is a FOX News Medical contributor. He joins us tonight. Doctor, thanks for coming on. So what is this illness?\\n\\nDR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Well, Tucker, the National Aphasia Association says that 85 percent of Americans don\\'t know what aphasia is, but they are learning it tonight, aren\\'t they, because of Bruce Willis in our celebrity saturated culture. And I think it\\'s a good thing that they\\'re learning about it.\\n\\nWhat is aphasia? Aphasia is an inability to express yourself to put in words things, to understand language, to get the words right, or to comprehend the words. And I\\'ll show you on the brain here where it is. It\\'s on the left side of the brain.\\n\\nTucker, the front is called Broca\\'s aphasia in the back, it\\'s Wernicke\\'s. You could have both, but it really gives you cognitive problems. And we don\\'t know in Bruce Willis\\'s case, what\\'s causing this.\\n\\nOver two million Americans have this. Most commonly, it\\'s stroke. It can also be a blow to the head, but if it\\'s longer term, it can be a degenerative disease, it can be dementia, unfortunately. We don\\'t know what it is in his case.\\n\\nWe heard Demi Moore use the words cognitive impairment, but that could be any of the things that I just said. We don\\'t have a physical exam. We don\\'t have an MRI.\\n\\nHere\\'s what we do know, Tucker. We know that we have an actor, an icon that we all look to voyeuristically, whether we were watching \"Die Hard\" or whether we were watching \"Pulp Fiction,\" we projected ourselves into these films, and we didn\\'t notice necessarily how much pain he was going through playing his own stunts a lot of the time, what it meant to him, how it tore him down.\\n\\nBut tonight we need to make a change. We need to say we\\'re wishing well and prayers and hopes and everything for Bruce Willis, not the actor, but Bruce Willis, the man. Speech therapy may help. Retraining the brain to communicate in a different way may help.\\n\\nHopes and prayers to Bruce Willis, the man tonight, Tucker, not the actor.\\n\\nCARLSON: Tough diagnosis. One thing about life that is sad. Dr. Marc Siegel, great to see you. Thank you.\\n\\nSIEGEL: Thanks, Tucker.\\n\\nCARLSON: So several weeks ago, a January 6th protester committed suicide after he learned he was facing up to 20 years in prison. Now, here is the key fact to know. Like so many others that day, this man did not commit any act of violence.\\n\\nNow he is gone. We\\'re going to speak to one of his relatives, next.\\n\\nPlus, it has been bus it has been exactly a year since Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida was last on this show. At the time, he\\'d been accused of underage sex trafficking. He was never charged with that. So, why did the Justice Department tell \"The New York Times\" he was guilty of it? Matt Gaetz joins us for the first time in 12 months to the day, up next.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nCARLSON: Thirty-seven-year-old Matthew Perna walked into the Capitol Building through an open door on January 6, 2021. He didn\\'t damage any property. He assaulted no one.\\n\\nWhen he learned the F.B.I. was looking for him, later he turned himself in immediately. He was a law-abiding patriotic man. The Biden administration then tried to destroy his life. They charged him with crimes that would have sent him to prison for many years. Many of his friends, some of his relatives even disowned him. And in the end, Matt Perna killed himself on February 25th of this year, one of the saddest stories to come out of January 6th, and there are many.\\n\\nGeri Perna is his aunt, and she joins us tonight.\\n\\nGeri, thanks so much for coming on.\\n\\nGERI PERNA, AUNT OF MATTHEW PERNA: Thank you for having me, Tucker.\\n\\nCARLSON: So this came to our attention when we read the obit for your nephew that was so affecting, so moving. It made me emotional reading -- you were telling me off camera that the paper in which it ran tried to edit the obit.\\n\\nPERNA: They did. They actually refused to print two lines of the obit.\\n\\nCARLSON: What were those lines?\\n\\nPERNA: Well, the first line was \"Matthew was escorted into the Capitol by Capitol Police,\" which he had on his phone recorded.\\n\\nCARLSON: So you have video of that?\\n\\nPERNA: Oh, we did until they confiscated everything.\\n\\nAnd then the second line was \"There are many people responsible for his death.\" And they refused to put either one. They said we had no proof of either.\\n\\nCARLSON: The newspaper said that?\\n\\nPERNA: The newspaper did.\\n\\nCARLSON: So even in death, he was not allowed to tell his story.\\n\\nPERNA: Exactly.\\n\\nCARLSON: Okay. So that kind of sums up the level of injustice that we\\'re dealing with here. What was the Justice Department trying to do to your nephew?\\n\\nPERNA: Well, according to what his attorney told us was a week before Matt\\'s sentencing hearing on March, the 3rd, his attorney told -- Matt called his attorney and his attorney said that they\\'re going to delay the sentencing hearing, again, because they\\'re looking to add additional infractions, and we weren\\'t exactly sure what that meant. We thought was that a charge? And they said, no, it\\'s not a charge. They\\'re just going to try to influence the Judge at the very last minute.\\n\\nWe found later that that the enhancement, not infraction, enhancements were actually going to add eight points to his scale, like he was at a 14, they were going to add eight points and that would have bumped him up to 51 to 72 months in jail for a nonviolent crime of walking into the Capitol, not touching anything, not breaking anything, not stealing anything, and no altercations with police.\\n\\nCARLSON: Walking into the People\\'s House.\\n\\nPERNA: The People\\'s House.\\n\\nCARLSON: He was going to do more than four years in prison for that.\\n\\nPERNA: Exactly. And we are not sure if Matt knew how many months were going to be added to his potential six to 12 months is what his attorney kept saying, but that Friday evening, Matt hung himself in his garage.\\n\\nWe know he couldn\\'t do a day in jail. He had already put himself in a mental prison for the last year, more than a year. He was afraid to leave his home. They took away his income. They took away everything. He lost everything.\\n\\nCARLSON: For walking into the Capitol.\\n\\nPERNA: For walking into the Capitol.\\n\\nCARLSON: And you\\'re not leaving anything. I mean, we\\'ve looked into this. He was -- no one even accused him of hurting anyone or breaking anything.\\n\\nPERNA: No, no. And he just couldn\\'t handle it anymore. He was being persecuted and judged from every angle and we are talking about -- let\\'s talk about the people sitting in the jails in D.C. right now. They haven\\'t even been convicted of a crime and they\\'ve been in jail for 14 months already. Where does this happen?\\n\\nCARLSON: So this is what Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger and Nancy Pelosi are doing. Did any -- when he died, your nephew died -- did any of them call you?\\n\\nPERNA: No, as a matter of fact, Matthew Graves who is the District Attorney for the -- or the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, they took 14 days to drop the charges off of Matt, and still we have not heard one ounce of condolences or sympathy card or a phone call or anything. Nothing.\\n\\nThey just basically wrote him off.\\n\\nCARLSON: So here is a Republican voter obviously. No felony record that I\\'m aware of.\\n\\nPERNA: No.\\n\\nCARLSON: An upstanding, law-abiding, patriotic --\\n\\nPERNA: Never had a parking ticket.\\n\\nCARLSON: So he was driven to death by the Justice Committee. Did Mitch McConnell call to offer his condolences?\\n\\nPERNA: Absolutely not.\\n\\nCARLSON: No.\\n\\nPERNA: No.\\n\\nCARLSON: Okay. So how do you feel about the leaders of the party that he voted for and supported who have completely abandoned your family?\\n\\nPERNA: I know, with the exception of a few, I mean, we made dozens of phone calls to dozens of congressmen, congresswomen from both sides of the aisle, not one phone call was ever returned. And just a couple of months ago, you had Ted Cruz on here who called them terrorists.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry, but he could apologize until the cows come home. He said it, and you called him out on it. They are playing both sides of the fence here. They\\'re afraid of losing votes. They\\'re afraid of losing support, at the cost of what? People like my nephew, Matt, and how many more other Matts are there going to be?\\n\\nSurely there are other people who are going to be pushed to this brink. And we received -- we received thousands of things in his guestbook from other people who have, people that have January 6 cases against them, and one mother cried out to us, he has two sons that walked through the Capitol. So she\\'s dealing with this double facing felonies for walking through.\\n\\nCARLSON: My last question to you, and I just -- this whole subject makes me so sad and I\\'m grateful that you\\'re able to talk about it. Was he in Washington to overthrow the government?\\n\\nPERNA: No. Matthew was there because he thought for sure there was going to be good news that day that Pence was not going to certify the election, and it was going to be a celebration that\\'s why he was there. And it turned out to be the worst mistake he could have made. It ruined his life. And now we no longer have him and it\\'s a tragedy on all levels.\\n\\nBut --\\n\\nCARLSON: So these are the people being punished. There are a lot of people not being punished right now.\\n\\nPERNA: A lot of people are not.\\n\\nCARLSON: That\\'s right. Geri Perna, I appreciate your coming on. I know it is hard.\\n\\nPERNA: I thank you so much for having me.\\n\\nCARLSON: Thank you so much.\\n\\nSo it was exactly a year ago today, 365 days, that the Justice Department leaked the story to \"The New York Times\" that caught our attention immediately. They told \"The Times\" they were investigating Congressman Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, for a very serious crime: Under aged sex trafficking. So Gaetz made an appearance on this show, which turned out to be one of the weirdest interviews we\\'ve ever done, he denied it. He has not been on FOX News since that day.\\n\\nBut we did notice since we\\'ve been sort of following it, Matt Gaetz was never charged with anything. So how is that? The Justice Department calls \"New York Times\" and says you\\'re a sex criminal, and then a year later, you\\'re not charged with anything? So we thought it would be worth inviting Congressman Matt Gaetz back on the show to ask for an update, and here he is.\\n\\nCongressman, thanks so much for coming on.\\n\\nREP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): Thanks for having me.\\n\\nCARLSON: So you were described in \"The New York Times\" by the Justice Department as a felony sex criminal. Have you been charged? Do you expect to be charged for felony sex crimes?\\n\\nGAETZ: No, this was an operation to destroy me, to harm my family, to hinder my ability to serve the district and the movement that I represent in Congress. And we all know there is a pipeline of leaks and lies that flow from the Justice Department to the mainstream media, \"The New York Times\" in particular, and that is not even a partisan criticism of the Biden administration. That happened during the Trump administration as well. We saw it during the Russia hoax.\\n\\nBut the most important update, the most important thing that\\'s happened since our last on-air discussion, someone has been indicted and has pled guilty to trying to shake down my family based on this pile of lies, and so I\\'m not going to allow it to hinder me. I\\'m going to continue the important work that I do here in the Congress for my constituents.\\n\\nCARLSON: Yes. So I\\'m not going to ask any questions about your personal life, because it\\'s not my business. It\\'s really simple. If you\\'ve committed a crime, let them charge you. And they haven\\'t and they\\'ve smeared your name, again, your private life, it is your business. Whether you committed a crime or not, it is everybody\\'s business and you haven\\'t, and I just want to ask you one more time crisply, and clearly, do you expect to be charged for the crimes of which they\\'ve accused?\\n\\nGAETZ: No, that would be a travesty. I\\'m innocent. I have maintained my innocence. I have been entirely consistent on this fact. And each and every day, the lies about me unravel and are debunked. And the things I\\'ve said and admittedly, it\\'s pretty wild to come on your show and say that my family is being shaken down for $25 million by some fraudsters, some with connections to the Intelligence Community and the Department of Justice. But in fact, someone has pled guilty to just that.\\n\\nSo I feel vindicated each and every day that the facts are revealed, but I don\\'t want this to be a distraction from the critically important work going on in the Congress that my constituents expect me to dig in on.\\n\\nCARLSON: Well, you can\\'t allow the Justice Department to silence sitting Members of Congress with fake allegations of sex crimes, and again, if the allegation is real, let them prove it. That\\'s their job, not ours.\\n\\nSo I want to ask you -- also about the F.B.I. this -- so the Assistant Director of the F.B.I.\\'s Cyber Division, a guy called Bryan Vorndran -- if I am pronouncing it correctly -- came before the House Judiciary Committee, and you asked him a simple question. Where is Hunter Biden\\'s laptop? And here is how he responded.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nGAETZ: You are the Assistant Director of F.B.I. Cyber. I want to know where Hunter Biden\\'s laptop is. Where is it?\\n\\nBRYAN A. VORNDRAN, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE F.B.I.\\'S CYBER DIVISION: Sir, I don\\'t know that answer.\\n\\nGAETZ: I mean, Hunter Biden\\'s password on his laptop was \"Hunter02.\" He drops it off at a repair store. I\\'m holding the receipt from Max Computer Repair where in December 2019, they turned over this laptop to the F.B.I., and now you\\'re telling me right here is that as the Assistant Director of F.B.I. Cyber, you don\\'t know where this is, after it was turned over to you three years ago?\\n\\nVORNDRAN: Yes, sir. That\\'s an accurate statement.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: Wow. I don\\'t even know how to assess that. This is the Director of Cyber at the F.B.I. What do you make of this?\\n\\nGAETZ: If the laptop was Russian disinformation, as they told us for quite some time, you\\'d think they would know where it is. But of course, you see a circumstance here that just strains credulity. The notion that for three years, the F.B.I. has had this and the Chief of Cyber not only doesn\\'t know where it is, doesn\\'t know who at the F.B.I. we should call upon to test to see whether or not this laptop functions as a point of vulnerability for our country.\\n\\nBusiness deals kickbacks, who knows what else and that could actually be used to compromise the First Family. So, I don\\'t think we ought to question this anymore. That\\'s why I introduced the laptop into the Congressional Record, and it will be available for all to see soon. I also have filed legislation to strip the Security Clearances from the 51 National Security officials who all lied to the country and said this was Russian disinformation. We now see that being walked back with yet again, D.O.J. authorized leaks to CNN.\\n\\nI think it\\'s really something, Tucker, that CNN comes out this big piece today saying, oh, the investigation into Hunter Biden is heating up a day after the F.B.I. was humiliated by basic questions I asked in the Judiciary Committee about their efficacy, their work, their chain of custody, and the evidence they may have of a U.S. vulnerability that could be exploited by our adversaries.\\n\\nCARLSON: Yes, there is some going on there. There\\'s a move against Biden from within the Democratic Party. I have no idea what it means. But it\\'s obviously underway.\\n\\nCongressman Matt Gaetz, appreciate it. Thank you.\\n\\nGAETZ: Thank you.\\n\\nCARLSON: Just saying, by the way, whatever you think of Matt Gaetz or his personal life, whatever you have heard, it is pretty simple. If a law enforcement agency or the Justice Department accuses you of a crime, they have to prove it. They don\\'t get to just shut you up by smearing you. They have to take it to a Court and show that you\\'re guilty. And if they\\'re not doing that they\\'re not really a law enforcement agency. They\\'re really more like the Secret Police and you don\\'t want that.\\n\\nWell, up next, there was a Supreme Court ruling that you may have missed, but it\\'s kind of significant. It expanded tribal land in Oklahoma, and it\\'s had an amazing and major effect on life in that state.\\n\\nState law enforcement, for example, longer has jurisdiction to prosecute violent crimes. We\\'re going to talk to the Governor of Oklahoma for an update, next.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nCARLSON: When Wikipedia was founded in 2001, it seemed like one of the most remarkable things man had ever created, the largest encyclopedia in history, useful information on literally millions of topics for free and it was neutral, it was not a political enterprise. Larry Sanger cofounded Wikipedia, and then he saw it captured by political forces. So he left.\\n\\nNow he says, Wikipedia is a misleading mouthpiece for the people already in power. Wikipedia really matters because it defines how we understand the past and that allows us to make decisions about the future. So if it\\'s dishonest, that\\'s a problem.\\n\\nLong conversation with Larry Sanger for \"Tucker Carlson Today.\" Here is part of it.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nLARRY SANGER, COFOUNDER, WIKIPEDIA: There isn\\'t an open system anymore, and therefore the actual -- the kinds of people that are allowed to have any influence on Wikipedia have been narrowed down greatly to essentially people who agree with the establishment left.\\n\\nCARLSON: Well, it\\'s certainly noticeable. I\\'m rooting for its demise, because I think it\\'s so dishonest. It\\'s horrifying.\\n\\nBut tell us practically how that happened. So what\\'s the process? If I want to create a Wikipedia entry on something -- on you, for example, how do I do that?\\n\\nSANGER: So how do you make it -- are you asking how do you make it biased? Or how do you just make it?\\n\\nCARLSON: What are the mechanics of doing it?\\n\\nSANGER: At all.\\n\\nCARLSON: Yes, at all.\\n\\nSANGER: Yes. Well, in the first draft, it\\'s just you working on an article, as you would any like blog post, for example. You hit submit, and then the page is available for anyone else to edit, and then they do.\\n\\nOccasionally, there are edit conflicts as they are called, and then they have to be resolved a little bit. But that that doesn\\'t happen too frequently. If it\\'s very high traffic article, then people tend to make a lot of little small edits.\\n\\nAnd then the negotiation is actually where the interesting part happens. So there is a thing called a talk page and you use the talk page to discuss what the article should look like. And, you know the overall plan and to resolve differences of opinion.\\n\\nBut the talk page has basically come to be used as, basically a place where authority is wielded, you know, the old hands, the administrators and so forth. The people who are lording it over, the rest of the contributors, they hold chord on the talk pages, you have to get things by them if you want to have anything new added to Wikipedia articles, so the process has changed.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: Larry Sanger, cofounder of Wikipedia, a reminder when the internet started, it was going to educate and empower the population, It was not can be used as a tool of oligarchs to brainwash you. Worth listening to that. It\\'s on FOX nation, you can watch it now.\\n\\nSo nearly two years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the land that makes up five Indian reservations in eastern Oklahoma is in fact Indian Country, and that means that state laws do not apply. As a result of that decision, which relatively few people noticed, murderers are now going free in the state of Oklahoma. Here is a local news report.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nKIM WALKABOUT, MOTHER OF DANNY WAYNE REED: He would do anything for anybody.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He was her son, Danny Wayne Reed.\\n\\nWALKABOUT: He was 28. He is a father of two. He was -- to me perfect.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Danny and his girlfriend Cindy Jones had gotten into an argument at their home in Fort Gibson. Kim says Danny wanted to leave the situation and was trying to call someone to come get him.\\n\\nWALKABOUT: Before he can get the call made, she went and got the gun and come back and shot him. He didn\\'t make it.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Muskogee County District Attorney\\'s office initially charged Cindy with manslaughter. Shortly after, she bonded out. Muskogee County DA Larry Edwards says his office then upped the charges to second degree murder.\\n\\nWALKABOUT: The State was ready to roll with it, and then McGirt kicked in.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Since Danny was Cherokee, the McGirt decision meant the Muskogee County DA\\'s office couldn\\'t touch Cindy\\'s case.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: So parts of Oklahoma, big parts, are no longer governed by the United States. What is this? Kevin Stitt is the Governor of the State of Oklahoma. We\\'re happy to have him join us tonight.\\n\\nGovernor, thanks so much for coming on. This is one of those stories that I think most people kind of missed. What does it mean for your state?\\n\\nGOV. KEVIN STITT (R-OK): Well, thanks for having me on talker. I mean, it\\'s a real mess right now for Oklahoma. I don\\'t know -- did you say something?\\n\\nCARLSON: I just asked -- what does it mean for your state that it\\'s no longer part of the United States parts of it? Or what? What is this?\\n\\nSTITT: Yes, so basically, this all started when McGirt, who was a child rapist, showed his Indian card and got his conviction overturned. So -- and for those of you that haven\\'t been to Oklahoma in a while, it\\'s literally half of our state. So if you think about Tulsa, with a million people, we have now had a change of rules.\\n\\nThe state, if there is an Indian involved, has lost jurisdiction to prosecute those crimes. Our police have lost jurisdiction. And when you think about who\\'s an Indian, you could be 1/500th or 1/1,000th. I\\'ve actually got my Indian card, my six children with blond hair and blue eyes, they all have their Indian card. So our police are having a tough time because you can\\'t tell who an Indian is and who is not an Indian in eastern part of Oklahoma.\\n\\nCARLSON: So this is on the basis of race. So depending upon the racial category you\\'re in, you\\'re treated differently by law enforcement seems to be what you\\'re saying.\\n\\nSTITT: That\\'s exactly right. I mean, the cases are all over the state. I mean, one case I like to point out the Daniel Vivier, three really bad guys beat an 85-year-old man almost a death. Robbed him, stole his truck, and one of them showed their Indian card, he got out of prison. The other two are still in prison. That\\'s not equal protection under the law. So one guy is out because of race. The other two people are still in prison.\\n\\nI mean, Tucker, we have people on death row that are doing 23andMe DNA test trying to get their convictions overturned. It\\'s preposterous.\\n\\nCARLSON: Yes. So this is the equity agenda. This is actually what they want for the whole country. So I\\'m really grateful that you explained what it means for your state, Governor Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma. Thank you very much.\\n\\nSTITT: Thanks, Tucker.\\n\\nCARLSON: Thank you.\\n\\nWe will be right back.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nCARLSON: Oh, sadly, this show is coming to an end. We are out of time, but we will see you tomorrow night.\\n\\nHave the best evening with the ones you love. See you in 24 hours.', 'TUCKER CARLSON, HOST: Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.\\n\\nFor decades and decades, the Human Rights Campaign has been, by far, the most powerful gay rights lobby in Washington. You may have just heard of them recently, but they\\'ve been around for over 40 years, and for most of that time, HRC\\'s central goal, and they said it many times, was winning the right of gay people to get legally married.\\n\\nThen, in the summer of 2015, they finally succeeded. They reached their goal. The Supreme Court issued a decision in a case called Obergefell versus Hodges, and overnight, all 50 states were required by law to recognize same-sex marriage.\\n\\nSo, for the Human Rights Campaign, this should have been a moment of unbridled celebration, a dream come true, but it wasn\\'t. It was a crisis and if you don\\'t understand why it was a crisis, then you don\\'t live in Washington surrounded by non-profits.\\n\\nSo, by this point, the Human Rights Campaign had evolved from a scrappy little lobby into a prominent arm of the Democratic Party. It had a huge annual budget, an enormous headquarters building right on 17th Street downtown.\\n\\nSo, the Human Rights Campaign may have outlived its reason for existing. On the other hand, it couldn\\'t just disappear. There was a party to help, but there was a fundraising problem. Why would you give money to a group whose purpose has become obsolete? That was the dilemma and they\\'re not the first.\\n\\nThe Women\\'s Christian Temperance Union faced the same problem after prohibition passed in 1919 and you don\\'t hear a lot about the Women\\'s Christian Temperance Union anymore. HRC desperately hoped to avoid that fate and here is the point of this story: Amazingly, through clever rebranding, they did avoid that fate.\\n\\nSo, in 2014, just before gay marriage became law, HRC\\'s annual budget was about $57 million. That\\'s a lot. Listen to this, by 2021 last year, that same budget had expanded to $65 million. In other words, seven years after reaching its stated goal, its reason for existing, the Human Rights Campaign was raising even more money, a lot more money.\\n\\nIt\\'s like magic. How did they do that?\\n\\nWell, they did it by changing their mission. So, immediately after the Supreme Court\\'s decision on marriage, HRC began aggressively promoting the idea that the so-called transgender community was being gravely oppressed by American society, by you, and needed their help. In other words, all good people needed to send more money to HRC right away to help the transgender community.\\n\\nSo, the Human Rights Campaign\\'s 2014 annual report, which we read today, barely mentions the word transgender. There is no reference at all of any kind to the idea that a person can change his sex just by wishing it so.\\n\\nThat was during Barack Obama\\'s second term, but even then, that seemed like a pretty farfetched claim, but not anymore. It\\'s at the center of our national conversation and at the center of the Human Rights Campaign.\\n\\nTheir annual report this year promotes transgenderism on virtually every single page. There\\'s a long write up on the organization\\'s transgender justice initiative and a prominently displayed photograph of Joe Biden\\'s latest admiral, Rachel Levine. So, the rebranding worked terrifically. HRC now raises millions and millions from companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, Goldman Sachs, Raytheon, Morgan Stanley, et cetera, every power center in the American economy, all of which fully support now the transgender project.\\n\\nSo, if you\\'re wondering why the moment that same-sex marriage became legal in the United States, at that exact moment, your kid\\'s teachers began to deny the reality of biological sex, now you know why. It was all part of a fundraising campaign from Washington.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve ever felt you\\'re caught in the middle of somebody else\\'s fundraising campaign, guess what? You are. And as a result of that fundraising campaign, here\\'s what elementary schools look like now.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nPRESCHOOL TEACHER: This has been my first year in preschool with a class of my own. We\\'ve been talking about gender and skin color and consent and empathy and our bodies and autonomy. It\\'s been fabulous.\\n\\nELEMENTARY TEACHER: I teach my elementary school students about gender identity. Some people are girls, some are boys, some are both, some are neither.\\n\\nCALIFORNIA TEACHER: I tell this kid, \"We do have a flag in the class that you can pledge your allegiance to\" and he, like, looks around. He goes,\" Oh, that one?\"\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: So, every emotionally marginal young woman with a nose ring now teaches at your kid\\'s school. \"I teach my elementary school students about gender identity,\" said one on TikTok, of course. So how is a parent supposed to respond to this? We learned this weekend if someone tells an insulting joke about your wife, you\\'re now allowed to smash them in the face and you get an award for it.\\n\\nSo, what are you allowed to do if some unionized teacher starts talking to your six-year-old about her genitals? Well, nothing is the answer, not one thing. You\\'re not allowed to do anything. You have to sit back and allow that abuse to continue. Then you have to allow the medical establishment to profit from that abuse.\\n\\nOn its website, to name one among many examples, St. Louis Children\\'s Hospital now advertises for quote, \"puberty blockers, also called hormone blockers.\" These, it explains, can quote, \"help delay unwanted physical changes that don\\'t match someone\\'s gender identity. Delaying these changes can be an important step in a young person\\'s transition.\"\\n\\nNow, these changes are called biology. It is called puberty, which is naturally occurring. What happens when you stop it? Well, we don\\'t know because there are no studies on it. Probably nothing good, and the short term answer to that, is definitely nothing good.\\n\\nSo, this is not medical care. It is ghoulish experimentation on children being abetted by schools and cheered on by the Human Rights Campaign so it can raise more money.\\n\\nThe Attorney General of Texas correctly calls all of this child abuse because of course, that\\'s what it is, and he is launching an investigation into it and into hospitals that give children puberty blockers. Now, puberty blockers are not even, to be clear, F.D.A. approved for children who suffer from gender dysmorphia.\\n\\nSo, why is this being allowed? Well, asking questions about it has outraged the monsters who prescribe life-altering drugs to children for profit. The CEO of Children\\'s Hospital in Canada, for example, complained that what the state of Texas has done was a quote, \"ugly assault on the basic dignity of trans-youth and an obstacle to gender affirming care.\"\\n\\nSo, you notice what\\'s going on here. Corporations have seized the language of the civil rights movement in order to sell more products. Too bad they didn\\'t figure out this scam earlier. They\\'d be selling all kinds of products. Thalidomide would probably be on sale at your neighborhood pharmacy if they figured this out in the mid-60s, but they now have figured it out.\\n\\nSo, this is the environment, an environment in which healthcare corporations are proudly performing ghoulish experiments on the reproductive systems of children, that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis just signed a bill, a defensive bill, really, it\\'s called HB 1557, the Parental Rights in Education Bill.\\n\\nNo matter what you have heard about this bill, it is a popular measure. Two-thirds of Americans support it. In Florida, the majority of Democratic Party primary voters, the most liberal voters in the State of Florida, support this bill -- 52 percent to 36 percent. That\\'s why, as you would expect, HRC and its corporate allies in the media have lied about the bill and what it does. They have to because if they explained it, you\\'d support it. Here\\'s the governor of Florida yesterday:\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nGOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): These leftist politicians, corporate media outlets, some of these activist groups, they actually have read the bill and they are sloganeering because they don\\'t want to admit that they support a lot of the things that we\\'re providing protections against.\\n\\nFor example, they support sexualizing kids in kindergarten. They support injecting woke gender ideology into second grade classrooms. They support enabling schools to quote \"transition students\" to a quote \"different gender without the knowledge of the parent, much less without the parent\\'s consent.\"\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: Imagine if you pack your third-grader off to school to learn to read and do math and be prepared to be a citizen in a functioning democracy and while you\\'re at work, that child, that third grader, is being taught by his or her teacher, the one with the nose ring and the emotional problems, that actually you\\'re the wrong gender and you need to transition.\\n\\nHow is that not child abuse? If a stranger on the bus or in the park talked to your third-grader about her genitals that would be a crime, but it\\'s not when the emotionally marginal chick with a nose ring does it in the classroom? Well, it is a crime and the bill in Florida specifically bans it.\\n\\nThe bill bans any classroom instruction on quote \"gender identity and sexual orientation in grades K through three\" kindergarten through third grade. That covers ages five through nine. In doing this, Florida has moved away from the experiments underway in many other places. In states like California, for example, the state\\'s official policy declares that quote, \"Children as early as age two are expressing a different gender identity. It is strongly suggested that teachers privately ask transgender or gender- nonconforming students at the beginning of the school year how they want to be addressed.\"\\n\\nSo that\\'s lunacy, and what it does in effect is cut parents out of their children\\'s childhood and hand parental powers to people who aren\\'t even qualified to teach English or Math and they\\'re certainly not qualified to counsel your child to change his or her sex and almost everybody understands that.\\n\\nThis is lunacy. The Florida bill stops it and that\\'s why Americans overwhelmingly support Florida\\'s new bill. So, what do you do with a bill that has overwhelming support in a democracy if you and your donors don\\'t like it? Well, of course you have to lie about it and that\\'s exactly what they\\'re doing.\\n\\nThey are claiming that this new bill somehow prevents anyone from using the word \"gay\" in school. Watch:\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nDON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR:And I think about if I have a kid, if I\\'m going to, you know, would I be okay with them not wanting to be able to say the word \"gay.\"\\n\\nKRISTAL KNIGHT, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: And now this anti-gay bill or if you will, you know, you can\\'t say the word \"gay.\"\\n\\nBIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN ANCHOR: And a ban on the word \"gay.\"\\n\\nSHEVRIN JONES, FLORIDA STATE SENATOR: But he is (DeSantis) also trying to censor whether or not teachers can say the word \"gay\" in our classroom.\\n\\nJIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: Florida\\'s governor is now facing criticism after the State House passed a law that won\\'t let you say \"gay.\"\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: Just a little tip to our viewers at home wondering how to lie more effectively. As you do, look straight ahead, adjust your coat, look down a little bit like that and say, \"A new bill in the Florida Legislature.\" Once you establish that tone, it seems like you must be telling the truth. Of course, you\\'ve read the bill or you wouldn\\'t be talking about it on TV like some kind of knowledgeable expert, would you?\\n\\nWell, yeah, you would. You might be lying completely.\\n\\nNothing in the bill reflects your description of the bill, but because you have no shame, in fact, you\\'re working for a political party and not your viewers, you\\'ll say anything. So, they\\'re telling you that no one is allowed to use the word \"gay\" in the State of Florida because of this law.\\n\\n\"In Oregon, we say \\'gay\\',\" said Governor Kate Brown, who announced she is horrified and outraged by this. Meanwhile, Oregon falls apart. Walk through downtown Portland recently and ask yourself, is using the word \"gay\" the most important problem in the state of Oregon right now? Probably not, but at the Oscars the other night, actress joined together to scream \"gay\" repeatedly to remind us that yes, it\\'s the most important issue. Watch.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWANDA SYKES, ACTRESS: We are going to have a great night tonight and for you people in Florida, we are going to have a gay night. Gay, gay, gay, gay.\\n\\nREGINA HALL, ACTRESS: Gay, gay, gay, gay.\\n\\nAMY SCHUMER, ACTRESS: Gay, gay, gay, gay.\\n\\n[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: They are all such robots and then they cut to people in the crowd who are so proud of being gay, they hide it, which is the best part. Celebrating gay rights, but pretending not to be gay.\\n\\nRight, love it.\\n\\nAnd they\\'re saying this to a country on the brink of war that is growing poorer by the day from inflation, but here are your culture leaders, who are so far up their own butts, they\\'re leading chants about silly lifestyle liberalism that no actual person support. \"Gay, gay, gay, gay, gay.\" Okay, feel empowered?\\n\\nMeanwhile, back to the schools, which is the whole reason bills like this have to be passed. On MSNBC, one teacher talks about how he yearns to go into details about his home life with a captive audience of kindergartners.\\n\\nRon DeSantis, the bigot that he is, is standing in the way of this teacher\\'s self-expression. Watch.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCORY BERNAERT, KINDERGARTEN TEACHER: We should be able to have discussions and that\\'s what we\\'re encouraged to do in kindergarten. That\\'s what we do as educators. We build relationships with our kids and in order to build relationships, you talk about your home life. You talk about what you do on the weekends, that\\'s building community.\\n\\nIt scares me to death that I am not going to be able to have these conversations with my children because they\\'re going to ask me what I did on the weekend. I don\\'t want to have to hide that my partner and I went paddle boarding this weekend.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: All right, less about you and your partner paddle boarding, more about educating the kids. This is not some canvas for you to create your personal expression art. You are paid by the state to make people\\'s kids competitive in an economy that is going to need more competitive Americans. So, why don\\'t you stop talking about yourself and do your job?\\n\\nOf course, that\\'s the last thing they want to do. Some of the most powerful corporations in this country, through groups like the HRC have decided to push this propaganda as hard as they possibly can.\\n\\nThey don\\'t care what you think because it is not about democracy, it is not about what parents want. Disney for example is a major donor to the HRC and has been pretty explicit about this point.\\n\\nQuote: \"Florida\\'s HB 1557 also known as the Don\\'t Say Gay Bill should never have passed and should never have been signed into law.\" Disney said in an official statement.\\n\\nThis is the company you also hand your kids over to -- woohoo, we are not creepy -- quote: \"Our goal, as a company, is for this law to be repealed by the Legislature or struck down in the courts.\" So, let\\'s just think about this for a minute. Here you have a law passed in a democratically elected state legislature, signed by a democratically elected governor, supported by the majority of Florida voters, but it must be struck down because the oligarchs at the mouse company don\\'t like it.\\n\\nOh. So, shouldn\\'t you get back to making kids movies propagandizing for China? Shouldn\\'t you get back to wrecking the State of Florida with your pollutants, you environmental criminals? Yes, well, they\\'ve got other business and their main \"goal as a company\" is now to teach kindergartens in Florida that they can, in fact, change their gender just by wishing it so.\\n\\nIt makes you wonder if kids in Florida can consent to chemical castration with no parental involvement. It that can be true, what exactly can\\'t they consent to once we set that standard? Disney didn\\'t say, but maybe there\\'s another agenda here. Nor did they explain their fixation on the sexuality of children, but it\\'s worth pointing out that four Disney employees were just busted in a major human trafficking sting, including one employee who allegedly sent sexually explicit texts to a detective posing as a 14-year- old.\\n\\nThat bust occurred, as you may have guessed by now, in the State of Florida.\\n\\nRon DeSantis is the governor of the State of Florida. We\\'re delighted to have him join us tonight. Governor, thanks so much for coming.\\n\\nI have to say, you\\'re one of the only politicians I\\'ve ever seen. So many Republican governors in red states really are some of the weakest people in the country have caved, you have not caved. You\\'ve really tried to explain what this bill is about. If you\\'ll just do it quickly for us once again, what is this bill?\\n\\nDESANTIS: Well, this bill is about providing protection so that they know they can send their young kids to school, without them being sexualized, without a school telling a young girl, for example, that she may really be a boy.\\n\\nAnd if schools are trying to do things that impact the health and wellbeing of the kids and they are undertaking certain services, that parents have a right to know that and provide consent for it.\\n\\nSo, this is a real bill that empowers parents, it protects our kids, and for a company like Disney to say that this bill should have never passed. First of all, Tucker, they weren\\'t saying anything when this was going through the House. They only started doing this because the mob, the woke mob came after them.\\n\\nBut put that aside, for them to say that them as a California-based company, are going to work to take those California values and overturn a law that was duly enacted, and as you said, supported by a strong majority of Floridians, they don\\'t run this state. They will never run this state as long as I\\'m Governor.\\n\\nCARLSON: Yes, they haven\\'t improved Orlando I noticed, why don\\'t they throw some money into downtown Orlando and help the people who live there. I have to ask you this since we are on the topic of Disney. Journalist, Chris Rufo, has really done a lot has just obtained a video of an all-hands meeting at Disney.\\n\\nThe meeting was in response to the legislation you signed in Florida. Here is Disney corporate President, Karey Burke. Watch this.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nKAREY BURKE, DISNEY CORPORATE PRESIDENT: I\\'m here as a mother of two queer children actually, one transgender child and one pansexual child and also as a leader.\\n\\nMany, many, many LGBTQIA characters in our stories and yet, we don\\'t have enough leads and narratives in which gay characters just get to be characters and not have to be about gay stories.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: So I don\\'t understand why an entertainment company that makes animated movies gets to control legislation in your state.\\n\\nDESANTIS: And especially, Tucker, you\\'ve got to wonder like why is the hill to die on to have transgenderism injected into kindergarten classrooms or woke gender ideology injected into second grade classroom? Why is that the hill to die on? Meanwhile, if we had done a bill that prohibited talking about the abuse of Uyghurs in China, Disney would have supported that legislation because they don\\'t want to say a word about that.\\n\\nSo it\\'s just an odd manifestation of their corporate values that they actually do Disney cruises, Tucker, to the nation of Dominica, which criminalizes homosexuality, so they\\'re fine doing that and lining their pockets. They\\'re fine lining their pockets from the CCP and all the atrocities that go on there, but it is those kindergarteners in Florida that they really want to have transgenderism as part of their core curriculum in school.\\n\\nCARLSON: And talking to kids about their genitals, like I thought that was -- I\\'m not a lawyer. I thought that would be a crime. Right? No? It should be?\\n\\nDESANTIS: Tucker, I mean, I think about when I was in school, we just did schoolwork. You know, we did things like Math and Science and Reading. I don\\'t even know how this would become fodder for a second grade classroom.\\n\\nAnd so the fact that they\\'re going to this lengths to try to torpedo legislation that I think 90 percent of parents probably view as just commonsense, it really makes you wonder, you know, about what\\'s motivating this decision making.\\n\\nCARLSON: It really does, and just to be clear, final question. I read the bill. It doesn\\'t say anything about gay marriage, does it? Is it an anti- gay marriage bill?\\n\\nDESANTIS: Tucker, Tucker, the word gay is not in the legislation.\\n\\nCARLSON: Right.\\n\\nDESANTIS: So they say it\\'s banning a word that literally isn\\'t even in the legislation. It\\'s not even like they\\'re misrepresenting the way the word is used, it is not even used in the bill. It is a fake narrative, it\\'s a lie, but it\\'s a lie because they have to lie because if they admitted what they were really for -- sexualizing kindergarteners and first graders -- they know that would not fly with the public.\\n\\nCARLSON: Man, you\\'ve got a lot of juevos to do this, and I appreciate it and I hope all the other cowards sitting in Governor\\'s Offices around the country watch this.\\n\\nRon DeSantis, thank you.\\n\\nDESANTIS: Thank you.\\n\\nCARLSON: So Adam Kinzinger, as we\\'ve told you many times is deeply upset about democracy, which the big orange man who last occupied the White House destroyed, very upset about that. What you may not have known is that not so long ago, he was begging Donald Trump for a job.\\n\\nReally? Quite a story. Adam Kinzinger, we\\'ve got that update.\\n\\nAlso talking about Ukraine is now about proving your own virtue, you may have noticed, no offense to the people of Ukraine. It is about our reaction to the war in Ukraine, and we\\'ve got a whole segment coming up.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nCARLSON: Well, you\\'ve probably seen Congressman Adam Kinzinger of Illinois crying -- when you\\'re that age and in Congress, if you\\'re crying in public, there\\'s something going on. Let\\'s be completely honest, something deep inside that politics can\\'t touch.\\n\\nBut Kinzinger explains away his crying fits as grief at the end of democracy -- democracy killed by the big orange man who was President before Joe Biden, Donald Trump. So with that in mind, it\\'s interesting that not so long ago, Adam Kinzinger wanted to work for Donald Trump.\\n\\nPhilip Wegmann has looked into this, it\\'s a pretty amazing story. He is of course, RealClearPolitics, White House reporter, and he joins us tonight. Philip, thanks so much for coming on.\\n\\nSo Adam Kinzinger wanted to work for Trump? I mean, that\\'s not something I would have guessed.\\n\\nPHILIP WEGMANN, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, REALCLEARPOLITICS: So I think the context here is really helpful because while Representative Kinzinger has emerged as an anti-Trump figure of late, and certainly that has accelerated since he joined the January 6 Committee, a lot of this has occurred during the Biden era.\\n\\nSo for instance, recently, he says that his greatest regret is not voting to impeach Donald Trump in 2019. Well, that year, he was publicly auditioning to join the administration as Trump\\'s Secretary of the Navy. And then in 2020, according to my sources in Trump world, the Congressman was actively lobbying behind the scenes to get a member of his family a gig in the White House press shop.\\n\\nNow, that job didn\\'t pan out, and Kinzinger\\'s team tells me that the implication that that family member couldn\\'t get that job on her own is misogynistic, is garbage, but I think that that context goes a long way to explaining the deep personal antipathy that Kinzinger and Trump world have for each other at this point.\\n\\nCARLSON: So isn\\'t that something that you would disclose? I mean -- and his views have changed -- you know, a lot of our views have changed, and I understand that, and I think it\\'s legitimate, but shouldn\\'t he say, you know, I did once ask him for a job, tried to get, you know, a close relative as you put it, a job, shouldn\\'t he say that?\\n\\nWEGMANN: Well, he was auditioning for the Air Force gig on Twitter, and he made no bones about that. I think what is interesting is now Kinzinger is in a lot of ways a politician without much of a constituency. You know, he\\'s going to lose his district at the end of the year. Republicans see him as an outlier, and the Biden White House which I cover, I think that they are familiar with him only insofar as they\\'ve spent a lot of time rejecting his chief policy proposal of late, which is that no fly zone over Ukraine.\\n\\nSo I wish the guy the best, but I don\\'t spend a lot of time covering the Congressman. And I think that the folks who are really listening to his critique at this point, you know, are the holdovers from resistance Twitter, and at least one household in Mar-a-Lago.\\n\\nCARLSON: I hope he gets the help he needs. He wants to go to cable news, apparently. He is always welcome to audition on the show. We\\'ve invited him a million times. You want to see what it\\'s like, spend an hour with us. I hope, he will accept.\\n\\nPhilip Wegmann, I appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you.\\n\\nWEGMANN: Thank you, sir.\\n\\nCARLSON: So since the invasion of Ukraine kicked off several weeks ago, public officials in this country have pledged allegiance to Ukraine. Okay, everyone feels sad for the Ukrainian people, they legitimately are suffering because of the Russian invasion, but the way they\\'ve been touting their love of Ukraine tells you a lot.\\n\\nSo the head of the country\\'s largest teachers union, Randi Weingarten posed with this Ukrainian flag without realizing the flag is upside down. She stands for Ukraine, but doesn\\'t know what the flag looks like.\\n\\nNow, why are they doing this? Well, they want you to know they\\'re willing to sacrifice for Ukraine, which is very far away. They could not find it on a map. But they don\\'t actually have to do anything, and that\\'s the beauty of loving people you\\'ll never meet.\\n\\nAlexander Vindman is pretty explicit about this every time he goes on television. Watch this.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nALEXANDER VINDMAN, FORMER DIRECTOR FOR EUROPEAN AFFAIRS FOR THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: And we could do something to help bring it to an end before it escalates, and we\\'re not doing that.\\n\\nThey need more in order to avoid catastrophic civilian casualties, and that\\'s in the form of these jets, that\\'s in the form of unmanned combat aerial vehicles.\\n\\nWe lost the momentum. There was an opportunity to do this, and it is because we\\'re risk averse. We still think there\\'s a chance that this goes back to business as usual. You know, we are in fact, in a Cold War, we\\'re headed towards a Hot War.\\n\\nI\\'ve tended to speak -- to kind of lean in and talk about what more we need to do from the provision of weapons standpoint, because I don\\'t think we\\'re doing nearly enough.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: That\\'s a little weird to see that. So Vindman is from Ukraine. The guy in the box next to him, Max Boot, is from Russia. They\\'re both born in those countries, and yet they aren\\'t over there fighting in their homelands, which is a little bit weird. I guess it\\'s just easier to do. You\\'re fighting from a cable news box, States side.\\n\\nEddie Scarry has been following all of this. He is a columnist at \"The Federalist.\" He just published its own piece on virtue signaling over the war in Ukraine. He joins us tonight.\\n\\nEddie, thanks so much for coming on. Are we imagining this? Or a lot of people sort of expanding their moral profile at the expense of an actual country called Ukraine?\\n\\nEDDIE SCARRY, COLUMNIST, \"THE FEDERALIST\": No, you\\'re absolutely right. The left has completely trivialized this conflict, turned it into a complete joke all for the sake of getting clout on social media. And when I say the left, I do mean the media, celebrities, and corporations.\\n\\nYou look at \"The New York Times,\" David Brooks, you look at \"The Washington Post,\" Kathleen Parker. They are beside themselves emotionally about seeing Ukrainian President Zelenskyy in a t-shirt. They talk about this in terms of democracy and freedom and how it\\'s our duty to protect freedom. And again, major corporations as well, places like Uber, they\\'d say, you open the app, you just want to get down the block to a party, they say donate to Ukraine, I think they\\'re offering free rides to Kyiv at this point.\\n\\nPlaces like another app, Market Fresh, you want to buy flowers, they stay round up and donate to Ukraine. But just as you said at the intro of this segment, it costs them nothing. They expect nothing, and that\\'s the point of virtue signaling is that you get to feel good about yourself, you get to say how great you are because you care about this conflict. You care about the people, how noble you are, and yet it costs you nothing.\\n\\nBut it is going to cost somebody something because we\\'re teetering on the edge of World War Three. And yes, it\\'s not going to be the ones -- they\\'re not going to be the ones -- the Vindman\\'s, the Kathleen Parker\\'s, the David Brooks\\' -- they\\'re not going to have to give anything about this. It\\'s going to be you, it\\'s going to be your viewers, their children, their nieces, and nephews, they\\'re going to be the ones they expect to be sacrificed.\\n\\nCARLSON: You think one of these people say, wait a second, they told me to be mad about George Floyd\\'s death and white supremacy, then they told me to be mad about anti-vaxxers, now, they are telling me to be mad about Putin. Like, if you\\'re letting the oligarchs control your emotions, maybe you\\'re not an independent person, maybe you\\'re like a puppet. Does anyone think ever thinks that?\\n\\nSCARRY: Well, that\\'s right. I mean, issue after issue, virtue signaling is the way the left likes to operate right now. Same thing with the Black Lives Matter. Post a black square on Instagram and you\\'re in good company. They\\'re doing this now with something that we\\'re teetering again, on the edge of World War Three with a nuclear power.\\n\\nCARLSON: I mean, if you really think about it, it\\'s just so fun, I\\'m going to die. I\\'m no longer mad about anti-vaxxers. I\\'m mad about whatever, in Eastern Europe. It\\'s unbelievable.\\n\\nEddie Scarry, great to see you tonight. Thank you.\\n\\nSCARRY: Thank you.\\n\\nCARLSON: So a couple of weeks ago, we heard from the Under Secretary of State that there were deadly pathogens in labs in Ukraine that we were funding. So we asked like, \"What is this?\"\\n\\nWe just got brand new information on what it is and the Pentagon\\'s role in it. And by the way, what was Hunter Biden\\'s role in funding these biolabs? We have new details from all of those threads from this single story, which seems like a pretty big story, honestly. That\\'s straight ahead.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nCARLSON: So for months now, we\\'ve been reading mentions on the internet of U.S. funded biolabs in Ukraine and we have not taken the bait. We did not do a single segment on this. We didn\\'t even really follow up on the story. It seemed way too unlikely. The last thing we want to do is repeat information that\\'s incorrect or traffic in legitimate conspiracy theories, and those are real actually.\\n\\nSo we didn\\'t do any story about that until the day that the Under Secretary of State, Toria Nuland, who is in charge of the war in Ukraine told a Senate Committee that actually there are U.S.-funded biolabs in Ukraine and what\\'s in this biolabs is so dangerous, she is terrified it\\'ll fall into Russian hands.\\n\\nSo that got us asking in public, \"What?\" Why is the U.S. government funding some kind of biological research in Ukraine? What is it for? We were immediately shouted down. \"You can\\'t ask that question.\" But we can because we\\'re American citizens. It\\'s our money. It\\'s being done in our name, and so we would like to know.\\n\\nThe Biden administration, of course, didn\\'t answer. We found out from a separate source, the obvious, which is some of these are bio weapons, of course. Now, we know more.\\n\\nOver this weekend, the show obtained a number of documents from a former high ranking US official that show the U.S. government through the Pentagon did in fact fund research into deadly pathogens in Ukraine. According to one of the documents, sometime between 2007 and 2008, quite some time ago, the Pentagon approved the development of a quote \"multi-pathogen mapping project\" to among other things, quote, \"take molecular fingerprinting of pathogens endemic to Ukraine and strain transfer.\"\\n\\nSo it turns out what we reported all along was correct. The Pentagon is in fact researching pathogens in Ukraine. We\\'re still not exactly sure on why, the explanations they\\'ve given us are ridiculous. We don\\'t know how long this has been going on, but we know it dates back at least 14 years.\\n\\nNow, we reached out to the Pentagon to see why the DoD was researching pathogens, and if the research involved biological weapons, which we can tell you categorically it did. And they pointed us to a fact sheet that the Pentagon released almost three weeks ago that is filled with lies, and that lots of Pentagon reporters dutifully repeated as if it were true.\\n\\nSo the factsheet tells us that since 2005, the Pentagon has spent $200 million in something called the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program in Ukraine. Now, that program supposedly is designed to dismantle Soviet era bio weapons.\\n\\nBut wait a second, how long does it take to dismantle Soviet era bio weapons? And in fact, if those are the only deadly pathogens in the labs, why would we be worried that the Russians could get them because they would already have them. None of it made any sense at all.\\n\\nWe should tell you that in the Pentagon\\'s response to us, they did not deny the existence of multi-pathogen mapping that was mentioned in the memo we retained nor did they refute the memos existence. We also got a set of documents from the Ukrainian government. That group of documents lists 30 biolabs in Ukraine that got funding from the U.S. Pentagon.\\n\\nAccording to these Ukrainian documents, these facilities use the funding for research and the collection storing of specimens. What\\'s interesting is the Pentagon did not deny that it funded any of these facilities. In fact, the Pentagon\\'s own factsheet says as many as 46 Ukrainian labs got funding from the United States. Forty-six labs? Really?\\n\\nWe also learned a few days ago that the U.S. government was not only doing this, but other people were funding it as well, which is to say the research of some kind into deadly pathogens in Ukrainian labs. So we learned thanks to reporting from the \"National Pulse\" several days ago, that Hunter Biden\\'s personal investment firm got money to researchers who are working on quote, \"isolating deadly pathogens\" in Ukraine.\\n\\nNow, \"The Daily Mail\" is reporting that e-mails in Hunter Biden\\'s laptop confirm that that story is true. So again, we\\'re not exactly sure what this means or where it goes. But ask yourself, in 2014-2015, did you realize that Joe Biden\\'s son was helping fund some sort of research into deadly pathogens in Ukraine? Which is not exactly a hotbed of biomedical research. Why Ukraine? Why not Germany? Why not Japan? Why not a first world country?\\n\\nThere is clearly something going on here, and we have the right to know. Sorry, we do.\\n\\nJosh Boswell broke the story for \"The Daily Mail\" and we\\'re happy to have him join us tonight.\\n\\nJosh, thanks so much for coming on. I\\'m sure you\\'ve been denounced for writing this news story. So thank you for doing it anyway. What did you learn?\\n\\nJOSH BOSWELL, SENIOR REPORTER, \"THE DAILY MAIL\": Well, first off, I want to make clear that the Russian government is clearly pushing a propaganda line to try and justify their war in Ukraine. Right? They\\'re saying that the American government was working on bio weapons in Ukraine.\\n\\nI do not have evidence of that specifically, but I do have a lot of other very interesting evidence, which we should be asking a lot of questions about.\\n\\nSo what do we know right now? Well, we know as you said that the U.S. was funding these biolabs in Ukraine that they were looking at deadly pathogens. We know that Hunter Biden was helping raise money for funding, one of the companies involved in that called Metabiota.\\n\\nAnd we also know from my reporting, e-mails from Hunter Biden\\'s laptop, that not only was he involved in funding that company, but he was also involved in getting that company into Ukraine, getting it deals that it needed to be done, to do the work he was trying to do.\\n\\nSo for example, there are meetings that he had with executives from Metabiota, and it is really interesting the way that the executives speak in those e-mails. They say that they wanted to help assert Ukraine\\'s cultural and economic independence from Russia, which I found kind of odd for a company that is supposed to just be monitoring disease data, pandemic data. Why are they trying to also assert Ukraine\\'s independence?\\n\\nAnd there\\'s also a quote-unquote \"science project\" that Hunter and his business partners pitched to the Ukrainian gas firm, Burisma, allegedly a corrupt firm, and that he was working with at the time, and this science project involves getting Metabiota some kind of deal in Ukraine and maybe using Burisma\\'s high level government contacts in Ukraine to get that done.\\n\\nWe also know that the funding that Metabiota received totaled $18.4 million from the Department of Defense, a small portion of that, $307,000.00 goes to quote, \"Ukraine research projects,\" according to DoD records and government funding records.\\n\\nSo there\\'s a lot of questions here. Why was Hunter involved in this? Especially at a time, 2014, when his father Joe Biden, the Vice President then was in charge of foreign policy towards Ukraine for the U.S. It\\'s surely at least a conflict of interest there.\\n\\nCARLSON: Well, it\\'s so unbelievably corrupt. I could care less what the government says of Russia, about anything. I don\\'t believe the government of Russia, I care about the government of the United States, which I help pay for.\\n\\nSo these are fair questions, I\\'m grateful that you unearthed them, and I hope you\\'ll keep going, Josh Boswell of \"Daily Mail.\" Thank you.\\n\\nBOSWELL: Thank you.\\n\\nCARLSON: So even if you\\'ve got kind of a live and let live attitude about culture, which we do, kind of hard to ignore the fact that the people in charge of our culture are way up in your face with actual filth that tries to subvert your family and your values, they just are. That\\'s true. We\\'ll stop lying about it.\\n\\nCase in point, a rapper called Cardi B is about to make an appearance on a Nickelodeon\\'s kids show.\\n\\nCandace Owens on that, straight ahead.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nCARLSON: So we led the show tonight with the so-called Don\\'t Say Gay Bill in Florida that the media are all upset about that doesn\\'t actually say anything about gays, but whatever. Apparently Joy Reid over on MSNBC is particularly outraged that anyone would be attacking gay people, in this case, the dastardly Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, and that got us thinking: Wait a second. This is the same Joy Reid who attacked gay people repeatedly on her blog, and then when caught told us that blog had been hacked, and they called the F.B.I. to find out who hacked the blog.\\n\\nAnd then we thought about it, we realized, wait, whatever happened to that story? Did we ever get to the bottom of the hacking of Joy Reid\\'s anti-gay blog? And now that we think about it, now that we are connecting some dots because it\\'s what we do, could it have been Vladimir Putin who hacked Joy Reid\\'s blog?\\n\\nIf there was ever a moment in American history to reopen this investigation on National Security grounds, that moment is now. Who hacked Joy Reid\\'s blog and put those anti-gay words on it?\\n\\nWe implore the Justice Department to find out now and let us know, so we can do a segment on it tomorrow, and every day for the next month or two.\\n\\nSo, you\\'re a fuddy-duddy if you note that American culture is becoming like not really culture anymore. It\\'s like a lot of growling and sexless talking about sex, and if you think that\\'s an overstatement, check out this song from someone calling herself, Cardi B. Watch.\\n\\n(VIDEO CLIP OF \"WAP\" BY CARDI B PLAYS.]\\n\\nCARLSON: So you want something like that, and probably your first thought was: Man, I want my kids, my little kids to get a lot more of Cardi B. Like how can they experience Cardi B and the Cardi B lifestyle because obviously that\\'s not bad for them or anything? They\\'re not going to wind up in rehab or as hookers.\\n\\nWell, Nickelodeon has an answer for you. They\\'re going to put her on TV. Cardi B is about to entertain millions of children, probably when you\\'re not home. She\\'ll be a guest on the upcoming episode. Nickelodeon\\'s \"Baby Sharks Big Show\" next month.\\n\\nSo Candace Owens isn\\'t uptight or anything, but she is a mom. She is the founder of the charity, Blexit, so we thought we\\'d ask her. What do you think of this of this, Candace Owens? Great to see you tonight.\\n\\nCANDACE OWENS, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I think for the first time, I\\'m actually going to defend Cardi B here because this is not her fault.\\n\\nCARLSON: Oh, I agree.\\n\\nOWENS: It is not Cardi B\\'s fault that she gets a phone call from Nickelodeon executives asking her to do this. It\\'s not Cardi B\\'s fault that she gets a phone call from then, presidential candidate, Joe Biden asking her to come speak about issues in America.\\n\\nYou know, Cardi B doesn\\'t possess the intelligence that think through these things and wonder why are these executives and these presidential administrations calling me and asking me to get involved? Right? Her thoughts are probably much more short circuited, which is that sounds pretty cool. Okay. Okay. I\\'m going to do that. That sounds awesome. Right?\\n\\nAnd so Cardi B goes on these shows, but these executives know exactly what they\\'re doing. Right? They\\'re well-trained. They understand what they\\'re doing, and they\\'re trying to further corrode culture.\\n\\nYou know, for them having Cardi -- for Cardi B, this is okay, I have a daughter, an innocent beautiful daughter, and I get to now be on a show that she likes to watch. But for these executives, they understand they\\'re trying to present a gateway to children, right? Of course, you\\'re watching a show. You look up the actors, the actresses, and the voices. We all do this when we were kids, and you start following these people, right?\\n\\nUsually the people that followed Miley Cyrus all throughout her career, these people will now be looking up and saying as soon as they get on Instagram, oh, who was that person on \"Sharknado\"? I\\'m 10 years old now and I have Instagram and because this is the new world we live in, and it\\'s Cardi B.\\n\\nAnd what is she rapping about? Cardi B has been consistent. She\\'s rapping about drugs. She\\'s rapping about sex.\\n\\nThis is a woman who got on TV and spoke outwardly about how she used to drug and rob men. You can go look this up, you can watch it on YouTube, and there was zero remorse. She is not pretending to change. She is not pretending that she wants to be something different.\\n\\nI believe in redemption, Tucker. If Cardi B woke up one day and said: You know what, I\\'m a Christian. I renounce my previous ways. I\\'d say have her on Nickelodeon.\\n\\nBut none of that is happening. This is an attack on our culture, not from Cardi B, from the executives at Nickelodeon and all the corporates in America.\\n\\nCARLSON: Thank you for aiming the fire where it belongs. I appreciate it. Candace Owens, great to see you.\\n\\nWe\\'ll be right back.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nCARLSON: As we told you, it occurred to us in the last segment: Whatever happened that investigation, an F.B.I. investigation in to Joy Reid\\'s anti- gay blog? The original don\\'t say gay blog.\\n\\nWe\\'re going to follow up on that soon. So that is what we will be doing tonight.\\n\\nWe hope you have the happiest night with the ones you love. We will see you tomorrow.']\n"
