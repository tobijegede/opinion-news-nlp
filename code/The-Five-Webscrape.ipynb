      "  This is a rush transcript of \"The Five\" on March 29, 2022. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GREG GUTFELD: All right, I'm Greg Gutfeld along with Judge Jeanine Pirro, Piers Morgan, Jessie Watters and she plays volleyball on a ping pong table, Dana Perino, THE FIVE.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KATE BEDINGFIELD, WHOTE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: I think the words of the president here were incredibly powerful. He spoke personally about the moral outrage that he felt which is shared by people all across the world. It does not mean he is articulating a change in policy. It does not mean he's laying out a change in U.S. policy.Does he regret that those words at the very end of the speech overshadowed a larger message, which obviously he put a lot of thought into the days leading --BEDINGFIELD: Absolutely not. He spoke from the heart.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Is that Michael Scott and Pam? Brand new spin from the White House as they try to walk back their walk back after President Biden walked back his walk back over what he said about removing Putin. Apologies if that sentence just made your brain walk back. The White House now claiming Biden was speaking in his personal capacity about Russia's president even though they said he wasn't several times.Trying to figure out what Biden actually meant is so confusing that Joe actually had to use note cards just to get his story straight. It even came with the helpful label tough Putin Q&A talking points in case he got mixed up with other cards. And if you think this turned into a total disaster, don't worry. Don Lemon's got the White House covered.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DON LEMON, CNN HOST: Quite honestly I think this is a media manufactured story. I think we should ease off a little bit because that's not what the president said. He did not say regime change.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Okay. It's all just manufactured like the crime wave and Hunter's laptop. Jesse, the personal capacity line.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes, 25th amendment, right?GUTFELD: Yes.WATTERS: Do you remember that?GUTFELD: Yes.WATTERS: Remember that? What was -- what did Trump say? Television lying - -DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Camera (ph).WATTERS: Right. The best scores ever. Yes. I don't know. This seems a little more serious this time. Last time it was trivial. They're -- I think they might have to stop playing the hail to the chief when this guy walks in the room because he is not up to performing the duties we expect as a commander-in-chief.Has anybody seen the raw footage of his sit-down lunch at the mess hall in Poland with the American soldiers? The media is covering this up, but I got to the bottom of it.GUTFELD: Oh jeez.WATTERS: He walks in the room and there's no electricity. He starts telling a story about the last time he went to Iraq and saw Beau Biden. And he says, oh, Beau Biden wanted to hide his name so we changed it to Hunter. And then the story never landed and the whole place was silent. And then he just sits down and gets a piece of pizza. And I remember seeing the footage of Bush and Trump, you know, you go to a mess hall in a war zone wherever you are and you're serving the food you're lighting it up. There's selfies everywhere and people are juiced up. This place you could have heard a pin drop.PERINO: Yes.WATTERS: He sits down and he shoves a piece of pizza in his mouth. And you know what happens next, he starts choking. There was a jalapeno pepper on it and pepperoni and he starts having trouble getting it down.GUTFELD: Right.WATTERS: And they notice, the soldiers notice, and they start assisting him and they start handing him a glass of water. And he sips on the water and then he starts taking a napkin and he rolls up the napkin and he starts dabbing his forehead and he puts it down.PERINO: Hot pepper.WATTERS: There it is. Now, is this the way you expect the president of the United States to act with our soldiers, a couple of miles from a hot war with Russia? No. You expect more from someone like this. The wheels are falling off. This guy's like a vintage car. You see the gauges, the brakes are shot, it's no longer fun to drive it any place. This now dangerous.PIERS MORGAN, FOX NEWS HOST: Do you know why -- do you know why -- yes, but you know why he ate the pizza like that?WATTERS: Why?MORGAN: Well, Leon Panetta gave us the answer yesterday. It's because he's Irish.WATTTERS: He's Irish.MORGAN: And now being Irish, I'm Irish.WATTERS: Yes.MORGAN: Being Irish is now the go-to excuse apparently for every one of these ridiculous farces and I thought the moment yesterday when Peter Doocy very calmly as he does brilliantly just talked him through all the ridiculous gaffes then all the ridiculous walk-backs and Biden just stared straight at Peter Doocy and went, none of that happened.GUTFELD: We got that tape.WATTERS: Do we have that tape?MORGAN: None of that happened. It just didn't happen he said.GUTFELD: Here you go.MORGAN: Have we got it?GUTFELD: Yes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: That other leaders in the world are going to start to doubt that America is back if some of these big things that you say on the world stage keep getting walked back.JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICEA: What's getting walked back?DOOCY: It made it sound like just in the last couple days, it sounded like you told U.S. troops they were going to Ukraine. It sounded like you said it was possible the U.S. would use a chemical weapon. And it sounded like you were calling for regime change in Russia, and we know --BIDEN: None of the three occurred.DOOCY: None of the three occurred?BIDEN: None of the three.(END VIDEO CLIP)MORGAN: I mean, what does he mean none of the three? We heard you say it. But you're the president of the United States. We heard you say each of those things. Then we read the walk-backs from your own administrative White House press office. And then we saw you walking back the walk-backs and now you've moved to full denial mode, or perhaps more sinisterly he's moved to completely forgetting mode.GUTFELD: Yes, that could be.MORGAN: But he genuinely doesn't remember ever saying it.GUTFELD: It could have been, it could have been the hot pepper. You never know --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Yes. You know judge, I'm a -- I was gonna say -- ask you about, you know, having your most basic ideas on note cards, but I have that written down as a question. So who am I, who am I to judge, judge?JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I'll tell you this. I mean, either he doesn't understand the consequences of what he said or he doesn't remember. In either case, it's time for the 25th amendment. And you know who has to get involved in the 25th amendment?GUTFELD: Oh, jeez.PIRRO: The vice president, Kamala Harris, would be all in on that one. But the problem really is that he's on the world stage. He is in a nation that is literally next door to a country where there is fighting and we're on the verge of Zelenskyy thinks World War III.And when he calls, when he says for god's sake this man cannot remain in power, Macron has to pull him back. They have to have a phone call. The ambassador to NATO has to pull it back. These are very dangerous, dangerous times.And by the way, the Russians themselves are fed up. Their economy is shot. They're losing people they don't even know how many people. Their ruble doesn't amount to much anymore.GUTFELD: That's bounce back, the ruble.PIRRO: Yes. Is it?GUTFELD: I actually read that.PIRRO: When did it bounce back, today?GUTFELD: Yes. It bounced back. It's actually showing -- doing well against the Euro. Somebody was watching FBN today. I pretended I read an article. No one believes me.MORGAN: But didn't you find -- didn't you find the Irish thing, the most ridiculous thing (inaudible) ever heard.GUTFELD: Yes. That's when you're digging.WATTERS: You know what that reminds me of? Remember when Cuomo was getting a little handsy and he goes, hey, I'm Italian. I just touch people.GUTFELD: Yes. You know, Dana, do you want me to ask you a serious question?PERINO: Sure.GUTFELD: You and I both love reading Niall Ferguson. He believes that our White House wants to prolong -- to prolong this war to bleed Russia dry, but also to defend the Ukrainians because it satisfies public opinion, but without costing American lives. However, you're risking thousands dead Ukrainians and millions of homeless just to bleed the country dry. That doesn't seem like a moral stance.PERINO: You know, well, one thing I want to get to that question, but on the point about the president having note cards, some people have them all right.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: But one of the things he was saying is he was expressing a moral outrage.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: When you express a moral outrage you don't need notes.GUTFELD: Exactly.PERINO: Because that comes from the heart. I also do not believe that you can claim that a president of the United States on the world stage at a speech that they build as the most important speech so far that the president has given in this war is done in his personal capacity.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: That's just not believable to me and that's why the European leaders were like whoa, let me back away from this and they had to have that meeting this morning. To Neall's point, Neall Ferguson.GUTFELD: Yes. Not Nile (ph)PERINO: Not Neil (ph), not Nile (ph).GUTFELD: And Beau not (inaudible).WATTERS: The \"U\" is silent.PERINO: I think that what he's talking about might be the practical result of what's going on.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: I don't know if it's the intention or the strategy because it seems to me if you wanted to bleed Russia dry you would have started with the sanctions, which would have had the benefit of possibly deterring this whole situation in the first place. And certainly Zelenskyy thinks that.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: Because now you have a situation where multiple cities are destroyed. You have millions of people that are displaced. You have a Russian economy that is going to be in dire straits even if the ruble does come back a bit. They are in a terrible situation.But the one thing that Biden, I think he does not want to do and we should not want, is for this to continue because of the risk of miscalculation or misrepresentation as you saw on World War I that led to the killing of millions, which led to the resentments of the Germans, which led to the World War II.All of that could be stopped, and that's why I think that we should be hopeful that this these talks are at least are ongoing.MORGAN: Can I ask one difficult question because I know this flies against the general narrative, but at what point is the red line for our morality - -PERINO: Right.MORGAN: -- the west? At what point do we watch maternity hospitals being bombed, refugees being targeted and murdered on the way out as they try and escape, Americans in lines for bread because they're starving being gunned down, holocaust survivors being incinerated in their homes as happened last week? What is our red line because we know what Hitler's was and we know when we stood up to him.I just look at what's going on and I'm -- I keep reading that Putin's losing. This is all going badly. Ukraine are winning. I don't believe any of that. I think Putin is doing exactly what he's set out to do. He's ruthless. He's barbaric.He's getting more ruthless and more barbaric and we're all sitting back hiding behind, well, he hasn't attacked a NATO country, but I bet if he prevails in Ukraine and attacks a NATO country what's he going to say? He's going to say if you come after me I'll use my nukes and we're going to face the same moral quandary of a guy taking nuclear armament as a protective shield to genocide.And I just asked the question because at some point we're going to have to stand up to him. Otherwise, where does it stop? I'm just throwing that out there.GUTFELD: All right.PERINO: Good point.GUTFELD: There you go. Coming up, Chicago's mayor getting extra police protection after calling to defund the cops.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Stunning hypocrisy from the corrupt Democrats who rule over crime ridden Chicago. As homicides skyrocket in the windy city, up 29 percent year-to-date since 2020, Mayor Lori Lightfoot can sleep soundly at night thanks to her secret army of cops. In 2020, a special unit of ready, 70 officers was reportedly created to keep the mayor safe, in addition to the normal 20-cop strong security detail she already has.This is really rich considering Lightfoot was a major advocate for cutting funding to police.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LORI LIGHTFOOT, MAYOR OF CHICAGHO: It is essential that the police department take responsibility for the way in which it's policed and the way in which it has in many instances alienated people of color particularly African-Americans in this city.We live in a city that is traumatized by a long history of police violence and misconduct.We can't rely upon the police to provide public safety.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Judge, why would you need 70 officers to protect someone like that?PIRRO: Listen to this. I am going to shock you. I have spoken to two rather significant high-level people in law enforcement and they tell me what I didn't expect I would be saying. And that is that the number 71 is not that unusual because you've got 24/7 operation, okay. And so it's around the clock. And you've also got the mayor's house, her security detail, and city hall.So if you think about that, that's a lot of people assigned. Now that doesn't mean that I forgive her for all her lunacy because I think that what she has done is terrible. Her job instead of blaming the police and saying the city of Chicago is traumatized because of the police, she should know from her own statistics that when she stopped defunding the police and decided to somewhat up the budget from not to where it was, but a little bit from where she defunded it, crime started to go down a teeny bit.She understands that police on the streets are what stops crime. And so she has a right to have her own, you know, security detail. I had a security detail when I was a D.A. I mean, it is -- its serious business and only they know what is appropriate.GUTFELD: That's the -- it's easy to talk about defunding the police when you've got up your own brigade, right? I mean, this reminds me exactly of like TV hosts talking about how important the shutdowns were because we still did our shows, like she has -- she never had to deal with the consequences. She never had to talk to the victims or worry about crime because it didn't touch her.This has been a problem with every -- in every city. They have to be stripped of this stuff. The moment that they say that they're going to defund something they should be stripped of it immediately because they've got a live. They should walk the walk, right?PIRRO: Well, that's a different issue. I mean, the question is, is 71 appropriate for your house, for the mayor's office, and your personal detail, the answer is yes, but I agree with you. People like Corey Bush, I mean, we want to defund the police, we hate the police, they're responsible, and yet you're spending $200,000 a year whatever the crazy number is. It's wrong.WATTERS: Joe Biden's still really on the defensive about to hold to fund the police then so he's throwing a lot of money at the issue and he was asked about it. I'm not sure if he had a note card for this answer, but let's listen, Dana.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNKNOWN: Is any of it related to political pressure from republicans saying that Democrats are soft on crime that, you know, that you guys are careening to the left?BIDEN: Ain't that kind of fascinating? When I first got elected I was being beat up because I supported the police too much for the previous 30 years. No, it's what I think.(END VIDEO CLIP)MORGAN: A creepy whisper.PERINO: I think that --MORGAN: It's so creepy.WATTERS: It is.PERINO: I think that is what he thinks and I don't think it is for political reasons that he has put this in the budget. Maybe a little bit, but his political problems for the midterms aren't necessarily on the right or in the center. His problems are on the left.Remember what AOC, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said last week, nobody on the left is energized by him. Nobody wants to get out there and campaign. They feel disappointed by him. And mid-term elections are about your base and he needs something for the base. That's why he put in the billionaires tax, which probably won't go anywhere and it was easy for him to say give more -- police -- money to police. I think he personally believes it, but all the people on his left do not.WATTERS: Piers, you went out and did a man on the street segment, which we're going to be airing tonight at 7:00. Were you assaulted immediately upon leaving the building by all these people out here in New York City?MORGAN: Celebrated would be (inaudible).WATTERS: Celebrate.MORGAN: Celebrated. You know what this reminds me of though, this defund the policing. It's the worst political slogan I think imaginable, you know, like 99 percent of people, they hear and go, what the hell are you talking about?So politically it's a complete fiasco, but if there's one thing that is guaranteed, doesn't matter where you are in the world, guaranteed to enrage an electorate it is elected officials preaching one thing and doing the complete opposite.And we've got a very interesting case in the U.K. right now with partygate where Boris Johnson, the prime minister, and his entire Downing Street staff having announced all these lockdown rules for the country and very draconian restrictions for, you know, 18 months. It turned out they were partying breaking their own restrictions every single week.In fact, 20 of them got fined today. We don't know who they are yet. It may even include Boris Johnson in which case his own position might become untenable. But the rage is not about the fact they were having parties. And the rage about this is not that Mayor Lightfoot is having her own security. I think most people accept that she needs it.The rage is the brazen hypocrisy. I'd like to defund hypocrisy because that is a corrosive thing for any elected official. It's the fact that she was out there saying we don't need so many police, but actually I do. You don't so you can all suffer the crime. You know my youngest son is currently at University in Chicago and he says it's scary out there.WATTERS: Is that because he's your son or is it because --MORGAN: That's the best thing about being in Chicago. People are stopping him in the streets saying, wow, I love your dad. No.WATTERS: Right.MORGAN: It's -- we'll see that on the video later unless you've (inaudible). Have you?WATTERS: Yes. We're going to make some minutes.GUTFELD: What's up with Boris' hair?PIRRO: Yes.MORGAN: I hate the thing about Boris' hair. I've seen him. I've seen him do this. I did a show called \"Question Time.\" Panel show in the U.K. about politics, and it was all straight when he arrived in Kent. And I watched him look around like that and then ruffle it up. It's completely deliberate as most things are with --PIRRO: What? Does he think it advantages him?MORGAN: Yes. He thinks the sort of, you know, slightly wild scotty (ph). He sees himself as a kind of Heathcliff --PERINOI: No he spends much time on making his hair look like that as we do in the make-up room.PIRRO: Yes.WATTERS: Speak for yourself, Dana. I wake up like this. All right, ahead, Dr. Doom is back, Fauci out with a new warning. We'll tell you about all that next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MORGAN: Well, Dr. Anthony Fauci warning of new COVID lockdowns as cases of an omicron sub-variant surge around the world. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANTHONY FAUCI, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF MEDICAL ADVISER: I don't want to use the word lockdowns that has a charged element to it, but I believe that we must keep our eye on the pattern of what we're seeing with infections. If things change and we do get a variant that does give us an uptick in cases and hospitalization, we should be prepared and flexible enough to pivot towards going back at least temporarily to a more rigid type of a restriction such as requiring masks indoor.(END VIDEO CLIP)MORGAN: But Americans apparently have had enough of the lockdowns. According to a new poll, 62 percent opposed bringing back mask and social distancing rules. This issue with Fauci, Greg, he reminds me a bit of Governor Cuomo. That at the start of the pandemic they were sort of heroic figures and it went massively to their heads.GUTFELD: Right.MORGAN: So the more praise they got, the more they went on television. And the worst thing I think for an elected official or a health official in a pandemic is to combine massive ego with a craven desire to be on television. Now, that may sound rich coming from me, but I'm talking specifically about elected officials and health officials.The more America sees a Fauci, the more it looks like it's about him --GUTFELD: Right.MORGAN: -- and not about actually the reality of people wanting to get on with their lives.GUTFELD: You got to know when to leave, you know. That's been my -- oh, don't even go. I just don't go, but you know, he's had a taste of this, right? And also there's something addictive about telling people how to live their lives.MORGAN: Yes.GUTEDL: I think I call it the ideology of punishment, it'll be my next book. But it's like it's a combination of like identity politics, COVID, climate. It's like I have to -- it's not enough to me to tell you that you're wrong. You have to be punished and I'm going to punish you like over climate restrictions. I'm going to punish you over COVID. I'm going to punish you because of your identity.That's now coming together and he and he's one of the -- he's one of the four horsemen of punishment, right? He's addicted to sadism and I've been there.MORGAN: Jesse?WATTERS: Yes.MORGAN: The thing about it is we don't want to hear what might happen that's bad. What people want to hear and the polls clearly reflect this massive surge away from wanting restrictions to the opposite because people want a bit of feeling good about life again. They want a bit of freedom. They want to get on with their lives, right? Dr. Doom appears and says it may be terrible.WATTERS: You know why doctor doom went on the BBC? Because Americans are sick and tired of listening to him. That's why. Next trump interview I do, you know what I'm going to ask him first question? Not about the hole-in- one.0 I'm going to ask him, what is the biggest mistake you made?And I know what he's going to say. And if he says something else, I'll tell him what his biggest mistake was. His biggest mistake was listening to Fauci on lockdowns. That was the biggest mistake we ever made. It was China's idea. It's a dumb idea. We've never done anything like that before in pandemics. It destroyed small businesses. It destroyed children. It isolated Americans so we -- it killed our spirit. We're people that need to be next to each other.GUTFELD: Not me.WATTERS: And it's -- well, everybody but you --GUTFELD: Yes.WATTERS: And you can even back it up because we shut the economy on and off. You can even blame inflation and the supply chain stuff too. So, it all goes back to Dr. Doom. And he's so arrogant, to your point, so arrogant and stubborn that he won't admit that he choked. And he needs to apologize to me personally. And I will only accept his apology unless he (INAUDIBLE).MORGAN: I'd like to watch that. Dana, I mean, the debate about lockdowns is an interesting controversial one. I supported the first lockdown at the very start of the pandemic in the U.K., because I felt with no vaccine and no apparent hope of any vaccine, and no therapeutic drugs to treat it, and with the thousands of people dropping dead every day, I didn't know what else we could do before we found out what we were dealing with.PERINO: Yes.MORGAN: But after that, once you get the drugs, once you get the vaccines, once it's demonstrated that you can get on with your lives and you either get jabbed up or you don't it's your choice, but if you -- if you do got a better chance of getting out the other end --PERINO: Yes.MORGAN: You have to learn to live with the virus. And him coming back like sort of the ghost of Christmas past, wanting his media airtime again to warn us something that may never happen, I think is a depressive tool we just don't need.PERINO: Well, it's also just not based on the facts, right? So, in March of 2020, everyone hung on every word the CDC said. We were hungry for it in March of 2022, everyone is like blowing them off. And it's very dangerous to have a centers for disease control that is not trusted or believed or look to, because there probably will be another pandemic, hopefully not, one as serious as COVID, but it could be.GUTFELD: We'll be dead -- we'll be dead by then.PERINO: It might -- well, that could be. That could be. I do think that President Biden should consider making a change there and to do it fully and to reestablish the credibility that is needed out of CDC because it's also -- it's not just for the United States, it's for the world.I also don't think that the governors are going to go for this, right? It was the blue state governors that led the way to start pulling away, one because their citizens demanded it, but also they saw all the polling, and they knew that that was just not going to apply.MORGAN: Judge I mean, the problem is he's obviously a very eminent guy in his field. He's done a lot of great work with things like HIV and so on. But I do feel watching him, it's the ego is driving all this, isn't it?PIRRO: Well, there's no question that ego is driving it. There isn't a TV show this man hasn't been on for the last two years.MORGAN: He should be on THE FIVE.WATTERS: He's even been on \"WATTERS WORLD.\" I'm not kidding. He went on \"WATTERS WORLD.\"MORGAN: No.PIRRO: Yes, he is.WATTERS: He wants to be on air, that man was.MORGAN: That's a desperate man.WATTERS: I know.MORGAN: And I figure, somebody on board as well tonight. That's how desperate I am.WATTERS: I'm on \"PRIMETIME\" now but --PIRRO: He was also on -- he was also on \"JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE.\" So, I also shared him on television. But what he's done is he's created a precedent so that the totalitarian instinct that they have on the left that we have to listen to, the people who are apparently -- allegedly is the better word -- in the know, they're now used to telling us what to do when I'm not sure they know what to do.And I don't know why we decided to be locked down based upon the opinion of this guy who was listening to Niall Ferguson, who was the one who talked about the Mad Cow disease in the U.K., which was a disaster.And so, you know, if this comes up again -- and by the way, the good news is, the U.S. is still experiencing a decline in infections, all infections. What we need to do is have a type of Manhattan Project, where we bring in the best and the brightest, where we bring in a doctor who not has been in government and politics for 40-50 years, but who doesn't have any interest in drugs and pharmaceuticals.I want someone who's clean, who's academically clean, and not someone who's beholding to politics or the drug companies.MORGAN: Or somebody you might have extremely uncomfortable questions to answer about the Wuhan Institute of Virology.PIRRO: Exactly.MORGAN: And the exact genesis of the COVID-19 pandemic.PIRRO: Exactly.MORGAN: because I don't think that is a sharp book yet. So, interesting stuff. Well, coming up, more fallout four Will Smith's slap heard around the world. Can his apology save his Oscar? That's next on THE FIVE.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PIRRO: Jada Pinkett Smith breaking her silence on her husband slapping Chris Rock. Writing on Instagram, \"This is a season for healing and I'm here for it.\" Will Smith also offering up an apology to Rock saying, he was \"out of line and wrong.\" But the damage has been done. The Academy could revoke his Oscar during a meeting tomorrow. And check out this exchange with Gayle King and Comedian Jim Carrey.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JIM CARREY, ACTOR: You do not have the right to walk up on stage and smack somebody in the face because they said words.GAYLE KING, HOST, CBS: No, no, I agree. I think we all agree on that. I just thought, Jim, that it escalated to that. You know what I mean? That it escalated to that level.CARREY: It didn't escalate. It came out of nowhere because Will have something going on inside him that's frustrating. I was sick and I was sick and by the standing ovation. I felt like Hollywood is just spineless on mass.(END VIDEO CLIP)PIRRO: What's interesting about that, Greg, is when the question that Gayle asked, it escalated, suggesting as defense attorneys always do, that somehow the victim had some role in the fact that there was a crime and this was a crime.GUTFELD: I thought Carrey was right though about the -- about the spineless Oscars, just everybody sitting there and not doing anything. That's kind of interesting to me. I don't know. Yes, it could have escalated. Who knows? I think that everybody's looking at this the wrong way.That slap helped save the Oscars. It's the second-lowest rating of all time. It would have been the lowest rating of all time. If it wasn't for everybody texting each other saying, oh, my God, and so on, and so on. So, I think they need to lean into this. I think that they got to make the Oscars more like Real Housewives, right?Seat the celebrities who don't get along with each other at the same table. Get them drunk. Have Ricky Gervais hosted after six pints. Let's -- this is the only way it's going to save the Oscars. No one is watching it because the movies have been -- turned into like bumper stickers for political identity. There's -- no one's -- no one's going to the movies. The great movies aren't being -- aren't being rewarded because the popular -- you know, the population likes them and you can't be like the population.PIRRO: Piers, doesn't violence like this that we saw, he walked up on the stage, no one even tried to stop him, doesn't that become now normalized? Is there a precedent created now?MORGAN: Either we got to get some perspective. I mean, there's a war on. I mean, there's a meme doing the rounds today and it has President Zelenskyy and he's on the phone to Will Smith saying well, I just heard Vladimir Putin insulted your wife. And it made me laugh but it also brought back to me perspective.Like he went up and gave a guy a slap because he thought that Chris Rock was deliberately mocking his wife about quite an unpleasant medical condition, alopecia, which caused her to lose all her hair. Chris Rock has told people, I didn't know she had alopecia. So, he's an innocent victim of this. He did a pretty lame joke and he got slapped for it.But he got a slap. I mean, you know --PIRRO: So, you think that words are justification for violence?MORGAN: No, I don't think -- look, you can't ever condone violence in that situation and I don't. But I can understand why if you're Will Smith, and you think that's what the guy was doing -- and bear in mind, he's got a bit of history with Chris Rock. He took down Jada Pinkett Smith when he hosted the Oscars five years ago quite personally and quite nasally. And that would have been in I'm sure the mind of what was going on.But you know, I'm hearing now, we've got to take away his Oscar. Really? Really? Let's remind ourselves, you have standing ovations. The Oscars crowd gave Roman Polanski a standing ovation, led by Meryl Streep after he was convicted of being a pedophile. He then went on the run. He remains on the run. And he's still got his Oscar. Harvey Weinstein in his cell has got his Oscars, right?The idea we're going to take away Will Smith's Best Actor Oscar for a brilliant performance and a great movie -- and I feel sorry for the Williams sisters, actually, because their story has been overtaken. But let's get some perspective here. He said he shouldn't have done it. I agree he shouldn't have done it. And I kind of understand this thinking that led him to do it.PIRRO: Well, you know, Jesse, there's a reason in the criminal law that we don't question the motivations of the person who assaults and instead decide a case based upon the facts and whether or not the crime was committed.He says that, that it's not indicative of the man that he wants to be. This is what Will Smith says. Do we -- are we so in love with the character or is that the real Smith, the real world?WATTERS: Well, the real Smith looks like a real monster if that's who he is. And his brand was about as shiny as your diamonds, Judge. This guy was Tom Hanks. He was The Rock. He was Clooney. He talked about a Q Score. There's no one with more commercial appeal. This guy was about as warm and fuzzy as Christmas besides Gutfeld, the King of Late Night.GUTFELD: Thank you.WATTERS: So, he took that -- and remember this guy gets slimed on Nickelodeon. Children like this guy. He was a rapper, a TV -- everything and he destroyed it with one slap. Now, I don't think my Jesse Jr. is going to watch him and see that clip and think highly of this guy. My twins are tense --GUTFELD: What did Jesse Jr. think when he first heard about this, Jesse?WATTERS: Well, he popped his head out of the crib and he says, listen, sticks and stones will break my bones. And you know, I'm ashamed of what you just said because you have all people should have thicker skin. If someone makes a crack about you, and you're that successful, and your wife is sitting there and she's that successful, it's a roast.MORGAN: There you go. Hang on. Hang on. OK let me take you back 10 years. I interviewed Jada Pinkett Smith at CNN and Will Smith turned up in New York. He turned up and he sat in the shadows like lurking. And he came up to me before we started he went, Mr. Morgan, don't upset my wife. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry. I now know what he meant.But I said to my wife, you've mentioned this, what would happen if it was in my situation? I said to my wife, let's be honest, if that was us, right, and you had a medical condition, and some guy ripped you in front of a gazillion people at the Oscars, how would you felt if I went up and slapped him? She went, I just told her daughter who's 10, I just said to her, dad would have done exactly the same thing.Violence is never the answer. And I genuinely think a lot of guys -- the polls by the way so the majority of Americans go with Will Smith.WATTERS: I interviewed Harvey Weinstein an event one time. And we finished the interview and I asked him, do you take any responsibility for any of your vicious violence that you put in your films? And he answered, and then he left and he came back and he grabbed me right here. And he said, don't you ever dare ask me a question like that again? Those people will reveal themselves in those --MORGAN: Would you ever slap a man --WATTERS: Slap a man?MORGAN: No, would you ever slap a man --WATTERS: Over a joke? No.MORGAN: Who humiliate your wife --PERINO: I'm good. I'm good. That's OK.GUTFELD: What if I want to be slapped?PIRRO: Dana, what do you think --PERINO: I'll take care of --PIRRO: It's Dana's turn.PERINO: You can tease. I'm good. I'm good. Go, go, go.PIRRO: All right. And his son said, that's how we do it. All right, straight ahead, Shannon Bream is here to tell us about her brand new book.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Shannon Bream's new book, The Mothers and Daughters of the Bible Speak is officially on sale today. You can grab your copy now at foxnews.com/books. And Shannon joins us to tell us more about it.Shannon, congratulations on the book. I know it's a huge undertaking. What is one of the things that you learned about -- you know a lot about the Bible and I'm curious what you learned in this process?SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: You know, Dana, you know what it's like to write a book and get into the research and get into the writing. And it can be all-consuming along with the other work you have in your life and your family and all the things that you enjoy.But for me, it really was this labor of love because I was reminded about - - even the stories that I thought I knew about, I learned so much more about each of these women. And I came away really encouraged because the Bible does not sanitize their stories. There are some with real struggle, real destruction, and pain, and struggle.And I thought, listen, the last couple of years, everybody's gone through some measure of that some greater than others, but to see how God was working in each of those situations, that he was shepherding and guiding and not unaware of the suffering was really encouraging to me. So, I got to know all of these women better almost -- I'm feeling like I know them, and I hope readers will feel that way too. But just the overall encouragement I got from it was the greatest gifts.PERINO: Judge Jeanine, you got something for her?PIRRO: You know what, Shannon, I'm so happy that you did this. I mean, your last book was great and this as well. But I was fascinated with the fact that you saw a parallel between the images that you're seeing in the Ukraine war and what Mary the mother of Jesus went through.BREAM: Yes. I think sometimes we forget that not long after a little Jesus came along, they were in danger, she and Joseph and little baby Jesus. And God came to Joseph in a dream and said, you got to go. I mean, Herod -- King Herod is trying to kill baby Jesus. So, here they are, no goodbye parties, no packing up and saying goodbye to family. They literally in the middle of the night grabbed what they had and took off because a madman was after them.And I was struck by that and reminded of that in watching these incredibly brave, courageous Ukrainian families, fathers staying to fight, mothers grabbing whatever they could packing up their children trying to get to safety, many of them flooding across borders with just the clothes and the toys that they could grab on the way out the door.And I love too, on the other side of that, that these Polish mothers in many train stations left empty baby carriages with clothes and supplies in them, just reminding us of the humanity that can come when we are in such dark suffering places. And the courage of these women, just like Mary was on the run with baby Jesus, and God knew every one of her struggles and twists and turns, I'm convinced that he is ever-present in our lives today. And these Ukrainian women are just so inspiring, watching them do what they have to do and being so brave in the process.MORGAN: And Shannon, I was struck by the fact that Ukraine is I think, is maybe the most Christian country in Europe. I think -- over 75 percent I think of Ukrainians identify as Christian. When you read the book back and you thought about the parallels with Ukraine, what message do you think the Ukraine people can take given their strong faith there?BREAM: Well, again, God is ever-present. We know that what we're told in the New Testament, Christ walking this earth suffered everything that we as human beings will suffer, and for most of us, even worse. I mean, the torture and death that he went through is beyond for most of us our understanding, but not some of these families that are fleeing Ukraine and suffering enormous personal loss.I've been struck by hearing from missionaries and different NGOs and people that are working in that region to help on both sides of the border. And we've gotten videos and texts from missionaries there showing people gathered in subways and in basements singing hymns together, trying to encourage each other in their faith, and finding great comfort and strength in that.And what an inspiration to the rest of us that they're clinging to the most important thing in their lives when everything else is just completely unsettled and unstable.PERINO: All right, Evil Shannon Bream, I'm going to turn you over to Greg.GUTFELD: Oh, I was just going to say what's up, ESB?BREAM: Oh, no.GUTFELD: How are you doing?BREAM: I'm good. And just today I was asked on a radio show, what is this all about with you being so evil? Greg must know what we don't.GUTFELD: I think -- I think it's time for you now to tell everybody why you're evil, Evil Shannon Bream.BREAM: Listen, I will say this. I am flawed. I am very open about the fact that I've done things I regret.GUTFELD: Very bad things, Shannon.BREAM: And I'm a sinner saved by grace.GUTFELD: You've done some very bad, dark, evil things.BREAM: And listen, we all have stuff, right?GUTFELD: This is all a front.BREAM: We all have stuff --GUTFELD: You're writing these Bible books as a front. We know what you're up to.PERINO: Shannon, thank you.BREAM: Redemption, that is the message.PERINO: Congratulations.PIRRO: We love you.BREAM: Thank you. Good to see you, guys.PERINO: Well, be sure to get a copy of her new book The Mothers and Daughters of the Bible Speak. It's a great book. \"ONE MORE THING\" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: OMT, Jesse.WATTERS: Jesse Jr. took his first steps yesterday. Let's see the videotape. There we go.GUTFELD: He looks like me on a Saturday night.PIRRO: Oh, that's fantastic.WATTERS: And now, he definitely see you on a Saturday night. I'm so very proud of Jesse Jr. walking like a champ.PIRRO: Yes.WATTERS: That's very, very cute. And tonight, \"JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME\" we have Piers Morgan, Kayleigh McEnany, Dana Loesch. And Piers hits a man on the street and he lived to survive it. So, we'll be tuning in for that.GUTFELD: Dana?PERINO: Well, I want to give a shout-out to Justine Rolland. She served in the Women's Army Corps in the Pacific during World War II. She was the first of 25 WACS to land in the Philippines. She was on the Intrepid at Leyte Gulf with MacArthur, excuse me, and was awarded the Philippine Liberation Medal.She just turned 100 a couple of weeks ago. She has three children, eight grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren. Congratulations, Justine. What a life.GUTFELD: There you go. Judge.PIRRO: OK, a 14-year-old boy by the name of Jackson Williams has his eye on the prize. He's running for governor in Vermont.GUTFELD: Comb your hair.PIRRO: Because he can't, he doesn't live in Vermont, he's only 14, but the law allows him to.GUTFELD: There you go.WATTERS: He has my vote.PERINO: Donate.GUTFELD: I know. And you know what -- and I like the -- I like to plant in the back too. All right, that's it for us.

      "  This is a rush transcript from \"The Five,\" March 24, 2022. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld along with Judge Jeanine Pirro, Jessica Tarlov, Jesse Watters, and recently re-elected mayor of munchkin land, Dana Perino. THE FIVE.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Putin was banking on NATO being split. NATO has never, never been more united than it is today. Putin is getting exactly the opposite what he intended to have as a consequence of going into Ukraine.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: President Biden at an emergency NATO summit trying to ratchet up pressure on Vladimir Putin. Biden allies announcing more sanctions against Russia, but the president losing his temper when pressed if he could have done more to prevent this war.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNKNOWN: What makes you think Vladimir Putin will alter course based on the action you've taken today?BIDEN: Let's get something straight. You remember, if you covered me from the very beginning, I did not say that, in fact, the sanctions would deter him. Sanctions never deter. You keep talking about that. Sanctions never deter. The maintenance of sanctions, the maintenance of sanctions, the increasing the pain.UNKNOWN: Do you believe the actions today will have an impact on making Russia change course in Ukraine?BIDEN: That's not what I said. You're playing a game with me. I know --the answer is no. We have to demonstrate. The reason I asked for the meeting, we have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly united.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Somebody did not get their pudding. As for the fighting, Ukraine says it blew up a Russian ship and is slowly pushing back Russian forces around Kyiv. President Biden appearing to draw a red line on what it would take for the U.S. and NATO to directly respond to Russia.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: I can't answer that. I'm not going to give you intelligence data, number one. Number two, we would respond. We would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: So, judge, I go to you first. What does Dana think about the presser?JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS HOST: Dana has been on television all day and she's been wonderful. I think you should go to Dana right away and then come back to me. If she didn't cover what she covered earlier, I'll fill it in.GUTFELD: You know, you said something today that I was like nodding in agreement because I was so -- I was like, why did he answer that question about 2024. And then the second part which is was that he lied. I mean he brought up that fine people hoax, which has been debunked over and over. Then he says that police officers died on January 6th -- no. But anyway, you had -- he was going -- he was okay and then --DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: So, it was weird. So, he goes all the way over there for this emergency meeting. I think it's good that the president went. I think it's good that they have this unity. He said that NATO is so unified and we all -- we all get it, Mr. President. We don't need to hear that again unless something happens.Then he only takes like four or five questions and then he goes to Der Spiegel. Now, most of you probably don't read Der Spiegel. You're familiar with Der Spiegel, right?GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: I mean, this is not -- this is the German --GUTFELD: The German beagle.PERINO: -- the German paper. They are very thorough. They seem to be very interested in American politics.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: And in one direction.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: So he takes the question and the question is about will you run in 2024? Now you could say, look, I'm here talking about this, 2024 is a long way off. I've already said I'm going to run again, but we'll talk --GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: -- let's talk about something else. Instead he said, you know, I really had to run and then he had to go back over and re-trot, retread through all of that ground --GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: I just wouldn't have done it.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: I wouldn't have done -- I would have said -- I would use that opportunity if you have the time, take one more question on the relevant points. I would not have done that on foreign soil, but he did. Okay, fine. I also thought that you have all these reporters. They are completely invested.They actually, you know, I think the coverage of the Biden administration in terms of what they are doing has been pretty good, but his messaging, their messaging is so timid, and you are sort of left wanting what is the mission? What are we doing? What do we want to have happen? What is the end goal? Did you guys discuss that?There's all these things that maybe we'll learn in the coming days that in the closed door meetings they had these discussions, but if I were Zelenskyy, I would have watched that press conferences just like, okay, do you want me to give the press conference because he could have answered it a little bit better.PIRRO: And I think, look --PERINO: How'd I do?GUTFELD: Okay.PIRRO: You did a great job, but you know what, one of the rules of Dana Perino's visit to foreign countries is you go there with the intent of announcing something, of delivering something. What did he say that was different? In fact, what he said was so similar to what he said before. He basically said, you know, we're going to respond to chemical weapons depending upon how much they use.I mean, it was just this kind of vapid vacuous -- we didn't know what he was talking about. It wasn't like the Ronald Reagan, here's what we got to do. We win they lose. Or how about this, Ukraine wins they lose. But at this point, it's clear that Ukraine is in a position of getting Russia -- Russia is stumped right now. They're embarrassed in front of the world.They hit apparently a Russian ship in that -- in the sea that's right below Kherson. So the question is, how are we going to do this so that Russia backs off or is Zelenskyy going to be forced into the idea that, look, just give Russia what they already have and let's -- and let bygones be bygones? No. Ukraine in '94 was told if you give up your nukes --PERINOI: Nuclear.PIRRO: -- we'll take care of you. We'll protect you. And they never did it. And now Zelenskyy is saying I don't want to be a part of NATO. All I want is I want to be a part of a group, the United States and the Ukraine - - United States, the U.K., where I'm protected, some kind of a treaty where I'm protected. That's all I want.And at this point what we've got to figure out is this guy's probably going to win this. I think Zelenskyy can depending upon what we're giving him and we've got to make a statement to Putin that, you know, you're out. We've got to fight you more than, you know, depending upon what you do, we'll do something.GUTFELD: Jesse, I want to play some sound on tape. We call that sought in the TV business.PERINO: Thoughts (ph). Thoughts (ph). Thoughts (ph).GUTFELD: It's of Admiral John Kirby talking about how Russians aren't communicating with our administration. Roll that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN KIRBY, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: We have tried on numerous occasions to connect Secretary Austin with his counterpart. Chairman Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has also tried to connect with his counterpart. We've made multiple attempts here, but they have not -- they have not answered up. They've declined to take these calls.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: You know, Jesse, I'd like to quote right winger Trevor Noah. This would never happen under Trump, right. They answer his calls. Does this matter because -- do we need to talk to that side? Do we know -- are we getting our information from somewhere else?JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: There's nothing more humiliating when the phone call goes straight to voicemail, whether you're a guy calling a girl, whether you're someone that's in sales. If someone doesn't pick up your call, that is really, really bad. So yes that's a problem. You know when you do an interview, Greg, and then after the interview is over you think, oh, god, why did I say it like that.That's how Biden must be thinking. They asked him and this is where presidents really get their chance to make a huge statement. If Russia launches a chemical attack what will the U.S. response be? These are the kind of moments that are made for presidential politics. You're in Brussels. There's a war. Russia is about to do something.And Biden mumbles something about, oh, you know, we'll do something. Joe Biden, speak. That was your moment to shine in Europe to say something that makes everybody proud and be clear. And then they said oh, you know, well, if Zelenskyy wants to negotiate some territorial, and he goes, you know what, if Zelenskyy wants to let the Russians have the east and that's up to Zelenskyy. I mean, what kind of answer is that. You're supposed to say no. You're supposed to have a little backbone there.And then he leaves the press conference after a minute or two and everyone starts screaming at him. He goes okay, one more question, and then he loses his temper. And he said well, the sanctions were never a deterrent. I never said that. Well, everybody else in your administration said it. Kamala, Sullivan, Kirby, they all said it. So they're not on the same page with that.And then he keeps saying the same thing. NATO is unified. Oh, well, so what if NATO's unified if Ukraine's getting swallowed up whole. You could have no Ukraine, but as long as NATO is unified, great.PERINO: Right.WATTERS: Zelenskyy can be dead. NATO is unified, so what. This is embarrassing especially the way he was walking. Did you see how they were guiding him like an usher takes a person to their seat when the lights start blinking before intermission? Like, this is the president of the United States. Come on.And then he says well, there could be some famine. And like we all know there's a recession coming and now we're talking about nuclear weapons. There's no urgency. There is no urgency to stop this war. He's like, would do a couple more sanctions, we'll sanction this guy, we'll sanction that guy. Come on. This is much, much more intense than he's letting on.GUTFELD: Yes. You know, Jessica, in the green room you were saying how embarrassed you were to be an American under Joe Biden and I agreed with you. I'm kidding, and I'm glad that we coordinated today. Care to respond to Jesse? Could you argue that Biden is trying to portray a sense of calm as opposed to urgency? Maybe that's his strategy. I don't know.JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I could argue that. I could also argue that Jesse's perception of that press conference was not in sync whatsoever with how I was viewing the press conference or I think a lot of Americans were and frankly people all over the world because Biden did have real deliverables. He said first of all out loud, I want Russia out of the G20. That's a big deal.When you say Russia should be out, that's kicking them out. We have a billion in new humanitarian aid. You're -- we're taking a 100,000 refugees. Apparently, I brought that up yesterday because we've only taken eleven thus far.GUTFELD: Right.TARLOV: 100,000 is still not enough but it's at least clear that they know that this is a problem. There's another $320 million for what they're calling societal resilience to make sure that the media can keep functioning that we're supporting LGBTQ people in Ukraine, et cetera. Those feel like real deliverables to me and --WATTERS: But wait, wait.PERINO: Except for not ending the war.WATTERS: Wait, Jessica.TARLOV: What? Are we going to end the war -- on the -- on the chemical weapons front, I do think that that is a big moment because if you think back to one of the biggest foreign policy blunders of the Obama administration, it was the Syrian red line, right? And now Biden's getting his own red line. And he should delineate exactly what that is.And I understand there has to be a commensurate response depending on what he does, but I would like to see and I'm sure Boris Johnson, the U.K. prime minister, would be fully enthusiastic about. The line actually can be really, really small. Though whatever they do, if there's a chemical weapon on the ground in Ukraine, we will respond to the fullest extent of what NATO can do, but I know you want to disagree with me about something.WATTERS: What did he say about chemical response? What did he say? Do you remember? I don't remember what he said. It was --TARLOV: He said there will be a response and it'll be proportional --WATTERS: (Inaudible), Jessica. It was (inaudible).PIRRO: The nature of our response depends on the nature of use. And the other thing that he said was these -- they're going to give chemical defense gear, chemical defense gear, everything is defense. None of it is offense.PERINO: Do you know what he should have said?PIRRO: And by the way, how can you refer to the red line in Syria under Obama and Biden? I mean that was a joke.TARLOV: I literally said foreign policy blunder, out loud on television.PERINOI: I mean what Biden could have said to that question about chemical weapons is that -- he should have said he better not, and leave it at that, because that was also one of the things. It's like don't say all the things you're going to do.GUTFELD: Exactly. All right, coming up, liberal leaders throwing in the towel when it comes to dealing with the surge in violent crime.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Sunny Sweeney in case anybody is looking for that song. A liberal city is now warning people to be careful what they wear to avoid getting robbed. This is terrible news for Judge Jeanine. The Los Angeles Police Department saying, \"What we're asking the public to do with these crime increases is if they're going to wear expensive jewelry or drive high-end cars when leaving restaurants, taverns, and other locations, they need to be mindful of their surroundings and be in well-lit areas.\"And rising crime isn't just a West Coast problem. New York City Mayor Eric Adams being criticized for consulting with Chicago's Lori Lightfoot on how to deal with it. He probably should have called Ron DeSantis.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: Like why are you calling the place where it's bad?GUTFELD: It does kind of -- it does explain why New York City is becoming like Chicago. There were like how many mass shootings over the weekend, 23 victims. That is Chicago. You can't wear jewelry or drive high-end cars, what is Fabio going to do? But this is the property version of don't go out in a short skirt, right?WATTERS: Yes.PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: Rather than change criminal behavior through punishment, we law abiding -- we, the law abiding must change our behavior. We must limit our freedoms because our political leaders are too scared of the woke that has infiltrated our justice system to actually make a moral stand.The woke left has made the criticism of criminality a sign of racism, which is actually more racist than anything because when you associate crime with minorities that's racist, and that is what the hard left progressives have done and which is why everybody's really scared. It's like you -- if you, I mean, if you actually talk about what's going on in the streets and things that you see to people, you -- people won't like join in and talk to you because they're out there, oh my god, I don't want to offend anybody.WATTERS: Yes.GUTFELD: Crime is now considered, like talking about crime is considered like a dog whistle.PERINIO: Judge what are you going to do?PIRRO: Well, I'm not in a position to do anything about it now, but when I was, I mean, nobody would get away with it. You just put these cases in the grand jury. Look, it's called victim blame. If you wear the skirt too short then you were asking to be raped. You wear a Rolex you are asking to be robbed.And you know what, we're -- you know, when you're out there and enjoying the fruits of your labor, if you're lucky enough to have a nice car, then you're teasing the criminal with it. Here's the difference, your life is forever affected by it. You're afraid for the rest of your life looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life while the criminal's behavior doesn't change.He just goes through that, you know, swinging door of the justice system, rarely will even get prosecuted, let alone booked for the crime. And in the end, there's only one way to handle this, and it's getting rid of no bail and it's making sure that we get rid of these woke prosecutors who are more interested in criminals than they are in victims.And this is the perfect example. You have people who now have to change their behavior because the criminals are allowed to do whatever they want. But my favorite part of this segment, I was reading about Mayor Adams, our great mayor, right? We're all willing to give him in New York City the benefit of the doubt.So he goes to Lori Lightfoot to find out how to fight crime. I don't know if you've been watching the news for the last 10 years. Chicago's a nightmare, okay. So, the reporter says every time I ask you about violent crime you say crime is down. This is to Lori Lightfoot. Crime is absolutely not down. Crime in Chicago is up by 34 percent.She gets angry and so he says to Lori Lightfoot, there's a 178 percent increase in carjackings in your city. Lightfoot's response to the question, you're one of the rudest people I've ever met. And you know, the reporter says, I think carjackers are rude people. But this is what's happening with woke mayors, with woke judges, woke prosecutors. They have changed the justice system and they are literally clamping down on us and our rights.PERINO: Jessica, you've been a lifelong New Yorker. What do you think?TARLOV: I think having been here many, many years now, almost 40 of them. Well, two away from 40.PERINO: (Inaudible).TARLOV: No, no, no. It was a couple of weeks ago. You can't call Mayor Adams woke, you just can't. If you've been listening to how he ran, even how he's governing so far, and if you listen to progressives reacting to Mayor Adams, you know that they're not happy with this. This was not the candidate that they wanted. This was more of the tough on crime candidate actually that kind of united minority voters and moderate Democrats in the city.Liberals who are concerned about carjackings and things like, you know, raiding drug stores and people steal, you know, breaking the windows at Chanel and whatever else that they're going to do. I think that these tips make some sense considering the current environment, but it's obviously not a solution.And it's not something that you can say that this is long-term sustainable to just say don't wear the nice things that you worked really hard to get and purchase or that you have to think twice if you're going to get your kid a nicer car versus, you know, a used car from 15 years ago et cetera.And I think that these tips for the moment need to be coupled with the real world solutions that you're putting forward like this is how we're changing.PERINO: All right, Jesse.WATTERS: I have a friend in Los Angeles and when he goes out on dates he will rent a Lamborghini for the night and he will go get a loaner watch to impress the girl.GUTFELD: Is this real?WATTERS: And then he will pick her up and then he will roll up at some hot spot and then he will get out in the Lambo and the rolly and he will flex. And that's what they do in L.A. If you can't do that in L.A., where else are you going to do it? Are you going to pull up in a Buick and a Seiko watch? You might as well be in Des Moines, Iowa, no offense.But L.A. is all about that. L.A. is all about hot cars, nice jewelry, and being fake or at least appearing successful. Do you even know what people in L.A. do? I have friends in L.A. They have all kinds of money. What do they do? I don't know, but they're constantly impressing me with all of their stuff.Now, if you can't go out and not have to worry about getting jacked, then what are you supposed to be, your own policeman? You're not supposed to be checking your six. You're supposed to be, you know, doing your thing. That's the police officer's job. That's the job of the city leadership. If they're not going to protect you, I mean, how about a tax cut, right?You're paying all this money for them to protect you so you don't have to protect yourself. Now you're saying you have to protect yourself. Well, give me my money back because what am I paying all these taxes for. The whole thing is ridiculous. You know it and I know it.PERINO: You know what -- do you know what your buddy -- you know your buddy should do?WATTERS: What?PERINO: He should also rent a cop.WATTERS: Rent a cop.PERINO: And that will show he's like --WATTERS: Private security.PERINO: Yes.WATTERS: That is a big power move.PERINO: That is a huge power move. Tell your friend.WATTERS: I will.PERINO: That's my tip. All right, up next, the media in a frenzy again over Republicans grilling President Biden's Supreme Court nominee.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Supreme Court hypocrisy on full display in the mainstream media. Liberals going into overdrive trying to defend Biden's radical nominee and absolutely losing their minds anytime somebody has the nerve to question her record as a judge.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOY REID, MSNBC HOST: Josh Hawley, you know, fist in the air Josh and slave holder descendant Tom Cotton reprised they're Qanon baiting smears against Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. They were treating her like a black shopper being -- that they were following through the store.JIMMY KIMMEL, LATE NIGHT SHOW HOST: A day of grandstanding and speech making and hissy fitting in the Senate today. No Republican has been more hot and bothered than Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.UNKNOWN: This is about midterm elections appealing to cultural wars, appealing to a segment of the GOP that is into conspiracy theories.BRIANNE KEILAR, CNN HOST: -- in particular, Senator Blackburn's line of questioning. Did you see racism in any of that?(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: All right, Jessica, did you see any racism at the hearing and can you give me an example?TARLOV: No, I saw -- I saw a lot of stuff that I didn't like. I did not feel like there were racial undertones to it. The argument that has been made about that is that talking down to someone and you can interpret some of these questions which feel like the gotcha questions like could you please define a woman, that that's talking down to someone, and then would they be doing that to someone who was a white nominee I think is the line of argumentation that it would do it.But I did not see that. I saw some stuff I didn't like and I went back though to look at what went on during Amy Coney Barrett's hearings just to make sure if this really was just a completely one-sided thing with the adulation that's coming for Democrats. And obviously we saw Cory Booker go off for a few minutes, but you know, filled with joy at the moment, and I myself am excited about it.But we did see Senators Tillis, Grassley, Graham, you know, going on and on Amy Coney Barrett is a mother. She has seven children, two adopted, five biological. Lindsey Graham even actually upped it to nine children by accident. He's like, well, I have two more. And then John Cornyn, he was the one who had her hold up her blank page of notes and he said isn't it so --WATTERS: Yes, that's good.TARLOV: That was -- what are -- if --WATTERS: It's a nice moment.TARLOV: Why is that a nice moment? I mean, when you think --WATTERS: I thought it was cool.TARLOV: You thought it was cool.WATTERS: Yes, that was nice.TARLOV: That she doesn't have to take notes and that should make you more qualified to be on the Supreme Court? So, that's a moment when I'm just straight --WATTERS: Well, she knows what a woman straight.TARLOV: Straight fawning.WATTERS: She knows what a woman is. Everyone does this Janine, right? The Democrats, they're nasty when the Republican nominee comes up, or vice versa. This is the way the game is played. The media acts like this is the first hearing we've ever had.PIRRO: Well, look, I mean, it doesn't take much to say that the, the, the way this judge is being questioned, is so much more polite than what they did to Amy Coney Barrett, than what they did to Brett Kavanaugh. I mean, it was just a circus. Let's admit it. I mean, everybody said they didn't want it to be like that. And the Republicans I think, had been kind enough to make sure that it isn't. But you know what the whole point of the questioning is to get an idea of who this judge is the judge that refuses to identify her judicial philosophy, when other judges do.So, we go through the truth finding process, we've done it for centuries. And the truth finding process is when you put someone under oath, and you ask them questions to try to get at the truth. And that's what we're doing here. So we have this, this this candidate for the highest court in the land where we got to ask her questions, she repeatedly tells us how much she loves America. She loves America, everybody's like, hey, this is wonderful. She loves America. But then she went to one that routinely refers to government officials, as war criminals, and it's not just in the caption, it's not just in the caption in a lawsuit. OK, number one.Number two, she repeatedly tells us that our brothers in law enforcement, she knows law enforcement, we're like, hey, that's great. But then through cross examination, we find out that with child pornography, she is down sentencing below the sentencing guidelines. And let me tell you what child pornography is. It's a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct. I don't care what her excuses. Now, I got a third one. She can't define what a woman is. She could have said, I'm a woman or a woman, you're someone who gives birth or anything, but she doesn't want to be unmasked. We unmasked her on the first two. Now, she doesn't --TARLOV: Unmasked as what?PIRRO: Let me finish. Let me finish. Number four, CRT Oh, I think it's something they teach in law school. We all know if you followed any of the news in Virginia, what's going on in this country, and it's not about law school, and she's on the board of a school where they're teaching critical race theory. Now, she has been unmasked differently. And now, we find out her philosophy. Does that mean she won't be a justice? She will be because they got the numbers, but let's not kid each other. If she'd been honest, in the beginning, we wouldn't have to go through the truth finding process. That's all I have to say.WATTERS: Dana Perino.PERINO: So, I'll just quickly say something. I'm going to channel Greg Gutfeld for a moment and just talk about the media for a second.Because if go back to Cavanaugh for a second. And do you remember when the media were the biggest drivers of weak rumors that then the media put forward and then they had to walk them back. And all of a sudden now the shoes on the other foot with Brett Jackson. And there's all of a sudden no intellectual curiosity about anything that's going on with some of these perpetrators that she sentences. When Kavanaugh was up, we had profiles of everyone who had gone to school with since preschool.And the Washington Post today was like, oh, well, the rubber cut Republicans have been so much worse. I mean, come on. Where are where are the profiles of these people? Especially the ones who reoffend it? Don't you thinking maybe be curious enough as a journalist, that might be something that you might want to follow up on. But they didn't do it?WATTERS: No, they didn't. Did they, Greg?GUTFELD: They didn't. they didn't Excellent point. You know, I saw racism it was in that media montage. If you can't ask tough questions of a person of color, then basically, that's a form of bigotry, right? How do -- you know, you know it's an essentially know -- and I know that sounds like a racial term, you don't if every time you ask a person of color of causes you to be a white knight, that means you don't believe that person of color can answer the question. That's what I see. But again, this is -- and I don't want to get Tyrus angry, this is a lot like professional wrestling. We already know the outcome, right?And but people, the politicians are still playing their roles. And you're right, they reverse every time. We know what's happening. I think the best win for Republicans is to let the Democrats win because they are as the judge says, hope that your behavior, your polite behavior might pay a dividend later, probably won't, but maybe it will. But at this point, all you are is you. You're feeding that media, every time you try to grandstand for a viral moment. That's what you know, Cory Booker loves to do right. Did he cry yesterday?WATTERS: Did he cry?PERINO: No, but --GUTFELD: Yes, I think so. But there is this weird amnesia, and I can't tell if it's deliberate or it's oblivious that in order for all of those in that montage to adopt that stance they have to forget everything that has happened in the last 30 to 40 years you know.WATTERS: Yes, I do know. And I think it's smart if you -- I do -- I think it's smart of you not to try to get Tyrus angry.GUTFELD: Yes, that's true.WATTERS: Because he would crash you like a grape.GUTFELD: He would, he would but I would enjoy it.WATTERS: You, sicko! Up next --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): He's perfect, he's perfect for now.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Nancy Pelosi has a new midterm message but who's going to buy that?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PIRRO: Democrats are struggling to find a good midterm message to actually run on but Nancy Pelosi thinks she may have just cracked the code.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PELOSI: Joe Biden is a great president, he is a gift. As I've said to him, don't say I told you this, but, but I've said to him sometimes, I'm glad you didn't win before because we really needed you to win now for president. He's perfect. He's perfect for now.(END VIDEO CLIP)PIRRO: How's this for perfect? Biden's disastrous policies have been so bad for the country that some Democrats are now even pushing for monthly checks to offset the surging gas prices. The President also underwater in the latest Fox News poll on key issues like the economy, border security, and inflation. So, Dana, is this president perfect?PERINO: That is spoken like a person who will not be here next year to dig out of the minority. So, we all know she's headed for the end after this time around. I mean, I guess, I could be proven wrong, but I doubt it, like she knows that this is happening that the Republicans are posed, posed to win. I will not say the R.W. phrase because we don't want to say that. But I think everybody know it. The members know it.There was another Democrat that just retired today. So, they all see it. They're running for the exits. Members in tough districts can't like what she said there because they're going to have to answer the question. Do you think Joe Biden is perfect? And the issues that are happening today, like Ukraine and Russia, Supreme Court, where his numbers are a little better? Those are not the issues that are going to be the main ones come November. Those will be what you saw in the second set of slides that you put up inflation, gas prices, COVID mandates in the economy at large.PIRRO: Well, and in fact, Greg, 38 percent approve of the Biden's behavior on the economy, 31 percent on inflation is policies, obviously.GUTFELD: Yes, I think it -- that, that tapes should upset just about everybody from left to right, because it shows how far removed from everyday reality these elite geriatrics are, right? They're, they're, they're old. Let's be honest, here, Biden and Nancy. So, they, they don't even affect -- and though rich and they're far -- they don't have the, they don't experience the effects of crime and inflation. That's not their concern. I came up with the law of an approach, approaching mortality.You don't -- when the movie is ending, and the credits are rolling, you don't go buy more popcorn. So, it's like, you know, what I mean? It's kind of getting towards the end. So, she's like, why get worked up about stuff? She doesn't -- it's like, you know, even if there's a war, it's not a big deal. I got a couple years left. That's what it is. It's a very selfish attitude. I know when I get to be that age, I'm still going to care about America.PIRRO: OK. All right. So, Jessica, two-thirds of America think that the country is on the wrong track? Is Joe Biden perfect?TARLOV: No.PIRRO: Is Nancy wrong?TARLOV: About this? Yes. But she said he was perfect for right now. And I do think that there is a case that you can make, frankly, he shouldn't have won the election, right? But historically speaking --GUTFELD: I agree.WATTERS: I agree.GUTFELD: Jessica!WATTERS: Thank you. Welcome to the table.PIRRO: Yes, yes, yes! Yes.TARLOV: It was such extraordinary circumstances that a president failed to win re-election because we were facing a global health pandemic. And he was someone that had proven himself to be frankly, incapable of managing it. And the people thought he was unhinged, not fit for the job, et cetera. So, Joe Biden getting the American Rescue Act passed, bipartisan infrastructure, those are things that do matter.But Dana is completely correct. When you go to vote, especially, you know, in a midterm looking at those numbers, you're going to be voting on the economy, you're going to be voting on inflation, and they're going to be some COVID voters. And it'll be interesting to see how the pullback of the mass mandates affects all of this.But when the head of the DCCC is out there saying, you know, things are really bad, we need to be messaging that we understand and that we care, follow his lead on that there are a bevy of numbers to back that up. So, that's the only message is frankly going to resonate with people right now who don't want to vote for Republicans, but they want to know that Democrats understand that they're suffering.PIRRO: OK, Jesse. So, what is the Bipartisan Rescue Act that Jessica just referred to?TARLOV: It wasn't bipartisan. Republicans actually refused to help Americans out, the American Rescue --PIRRO: The rescue --WATTERS: You mean, the one like three-and-a-half trillion that made inflation worse?PIRRO: Yes. Yes.WATTERS: And now, you want to spend more Biden bucks for the Putin price hike? Yes. Only the Democrats could think helping inflation would be to spend more money. Biden is a gift. He's a gift to the Republicans. I used to go out and do street interviews during the Obama era. And I couldn't get any Democrat to say one negative thing about the messiah. We send Johnny out now and black, white, young, old, male, female -- they hate the man.I haven't had one guy that says, yes, he's doing a hell of a job, and we're actually looking for him. With the Pelosi situation, come on do you ever go to a restaurant and you ask the waitress, you know, what about the chicken? Is the chicken? And she's like, oh, the chicken is divine. There's little reduction sauce. You know, how about the pork? Is the pork -- oh, the pork is phenomenal. And she won't tell you the truth.PIRRO: Yes.WATTERS: I had one time I was at a restaurant and I said like, how's the salmon, and the waitress goes, it's not so good. And I was like, finally someone told me the truth.PIRRO: Big tip. Did you leave her a big tip?WATTERS: A huge tip. Very unlike me.PIRRO: Up next, the ridiculous demand workers are making to return to the office.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)TARLOV: While more Americans make their return to the office, some are unhappy with the status quo. A post on Reddit blowing up with some workers saying they should be paid for their commute. Does anybody --PERINO: I don't disagree --PIRRO: I want to go to work in Florida and then I can go back and forth and they could --TARLOV: These commutes were shorter than that. And did have a lot of people on this ride who lived in the Netherlands.PERINO: Well, I think that, you know, hybrid work is here to stay. And I think the, the country was kind of headed or where the workforce was kind of headed in that direction anyway -- COVID was the accelerant, proved that a lot of people could work from home. The CEOs don't like it a lot. In a lot of cases, I don't blame them. I think it's hard to keep a corporate culture going. I don't see how promotions and all that are going to work. But that's for the managers to figure out. But their CEOs don't have a lot of leverage when there's 11 million open jobs and you're trying to retain talent.TARLOV: 100 percent. They're not going to say another number because it was 100 percent agreement. 60 percent of Americans say their job can be done from home and the efficiency has been proven out at this point.GUTFELD: I am so -- I love that word that people are working from home. Fewer conversations in the elevator. Have you noticed that? I have the elevator to myself almost all the time. And nobody talks to me it. Is the best thing. And you know what? I bet we are saving money. I bet you don't have as many offices --TARLOV: Well, you got probably the whole floor.GUTFELD: Not as much stinky food in the microwave. You know when you come into work, somebody is always warming up some old fish, it's disgusting. By the way, this is the real problem is our lunches are getting really expensive. Have you noticed that?PIRRO: Yes. Yes!GUTFELD: My soup, my soup is almost 20 bucks.WATTERS: What?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: At Halen R.D., it's like $70.00. If it's warm, I usually throw it at my assistant but I'm not too expensive.TARLOV: Jesse, how much does your lunch cost?WATTERS: I don't know there's no such thing as a free lunch, right? I just learned that you don't use moisturizer on your face.GUTFELD: That is true.PIRRO: But you do, Jesse?WATTERS: Yes, I use moisturizer. I'm a human being. Where do you crawl out off? Shame on you.GUTFELD: I don't know, I don't know what this obsession with moisturizer is -- look how beautiful my faces is? This is beautiful. I don't need to put crap on it.WATTERS: Yes, you do. You need a moisturizer, Greg. You can't just put bar soap on your face, you animal.TARLOV: He's very respectful of my topic today, Jesse. Judge, final thoughts?PIRRO: Final thoughts? You know what, everybody knows when they're going to work, they have to get there themselves. I think it's ridiculous to pay people. I like being at work. I like people. I like being with people, so but that's me.TARLOV: It is you.GUTFELD: You're a people person. I just came up with that phrasePIRRO: Yes, it's wonderful. What do you use on your face?WATTERS: I use moisturizer.PERINO: What kind?WATTERS: I don't know the name.PERINO: What's the brand? \"ONE MORE THING\" is up next.PIRRO: You know it. Well, then you use --(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: All right, it's time for \"ONE MORE THING,\" I'm going to go first. As you know, about a month or two ago, Greg's job search, thank you for that. I joined LinkedIn in order to get information on the president of a washer dryer company because I couldn't get a part. And but because I joined LinkedIn, you have to list your job occupation and I listed host because that's what I am.So, now LinkedIn sends me e-mails on job openings, including the welcome host at Cartier, which requires working weekends, and I give them a luxurious experience. Longhorn Steakhouse. I'll be -- I have to deliver enthusiastic hellos and goodbyes and then I have to clear and reset tables which doesn't seem like a job and I have to sanitize guest touchpoints. Fridays, of -- oh, I hope I get all that bling, right, right?I must be able to, get this, I must be able to carry natural conversation with guests without sounding scripted. Well, that's -- I can't do that. You see my notes. You know that's impossible. And boutique facilitator at Chanel.WATTERS: That's where your moisturizer comes from.GUTFELD: Yes, yes, yes, it's -- but I don't want to be a victim of a smash and grab Jesse.WATTERS: All right. I think you do want to be a victim of the smash and grab. We're going to a feeding frenzy. Here we go. Today's National Cheese Steak Day. And this is a cheese steak from shorties over in the west side, Hell's Kitchen. Did you guys know how the cheese steak was invented? Well, I just found out apparently in 1930, Pat Oliviere, sounds Italian. He was a hot dog vendor and he just threw some beef on the grill instead of a hot dog, threw it in a bun, Happy Cheese Steak Day. And Happy Jesse Watters Primetime Day -- it's not official, but we're getting there.GUTFELD: Yes, exactly.PERINO: A national proclamation.GUTFELD: Before Congress. Dana.PERINO: We mentioned Tyrus earlier. I want to mention him and his daughter. Take a look at Georgie and her dad here. She is a second-grader and she had a school project called wax museum day where she had to dress up and talk about a historical famous figure. Well, I did a zoom call with her because she chose me. And here she is dressed up as me oh for her project, and she had to learn all about me and she did an excellent job.GUTFELD: That's funny.PERINO: On her assignment. Congratulations, and thank you, Georgie.GUTFELD: Wow.WATTERS: Well, Georgie chose you for Greg.GUTFELD: Yes.WATTERS: That's got to hurt.GUTFELD: Jessica.TARLOV: So, watch this daredevil fly over the top of the ancient pyramids of Egypt, capturing stunning aerial footage, the paraglider Yanis Terzis was part of a special event that gave him permission you usually can't. This is just absolutely incredible. I would like to do that. I've never wanted to paraglide. Cool right? No?PIRRO: No.GUTFELD: No, you know what I would love to do up there.WATTERS: All right. Judge.PIRRO: I would do that.GUTFELD: Judge, it's you.PIRRO: OK. All right. I want to commend all of those animal welfare groups who are helping people in Ukraine. One of the things we noticed when people were leaving Ukraine, so many of them had their animals and their dogs with them, and their pets are pretty much all they have left. And so, there are groups like Paws of War and Humane Society International on the Polish border, distributing Emergency pet food supplies as well as emergency vet care at refugee reception centers. So, I think that's wonderful. Kudos to them.GUTFELD: All righty, that's it for us.WATTERS: You want some of my cheese sticks?GUTFELD: I really do. Smells great.WATTERS: You can have some.GUTFELD: Smells almost as good as Bret Baier.BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Hello, Greg. Content and Programming Copyright 2022 Fox News Network, LLC.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: The Supreme Court nomination hearing happening right now on Capitol Hill and we'll have more on that later.Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters along with Judge Jeanine Pirro, Jessica Tarlov, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld. It's five o'clock in New York City, and this is THE FIVE.President Biden touching down in Europe for an emergency meeting with NATO allies in an attempt to put more pressure on Vladimir Putin. Russia continuing its brutal assault on Ukraine but it comes with heavy losses. NATO's top commander now saying that Russia may have lost as many as 15,000 troops so far. Biden now fearful that a desperate Putin may escalate his attacks even further.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNKNOWN: What would you like to say to European partners?JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I'm going to say that to their face. I'm going to say all I have to say. I'm going to say when I get there.UNKNOWN: How concerned are you about the threat of chemical warfare right now, that Russia may use chemical weapons? How high is that threat?BIDEN: I think it's a real threat.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But the threats don't end there. Putin's own spokesman refusing to rule out using nuclear weapons against Ukrainian forces.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DMITRY PESKOV, KREMLIN SPOKESPERSON: We have a concept of domestic security. And, well, it's a public, you can read all the reasons for nuclear arms to be used. So, if it is an existential threat for our country, then it can be used in accordance with our concept.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Did you enjoy the president, Greg, coming out to the cameras and giving that statement?GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS CO-HOST: You know, I can't answer that. I'm not an expert on war. I was channeling to Judge Jackson.WATTERS: Very good.GUTFELD: Yes, I think it's fair -- I'm going to do that every block so I never have to prepare. You know what, I don't know what's going on. We need to have an expert here right now. Where is judge -- where is General Keane?First off, they are calling these emergency talks. Then why are they -- why were they -- why were they -- what happened three weeks ago? I mean, this was an emergency a long time ago. We waited so long it could have occurred before the war because we could see it coming. We knew there were problems. Those troops are amassing since April of last year.I'm going to go back to what I said before and you echoed it, which was Trump was pretty good at the stuff. I mean, we have examples from North Korea, even to Mexico trade talks, China, Canada. He knew that you don't do all carrots and you don't do all sticks. I don't know what the ratio is. I think it's like one stick to one carrot.WATTERS: No one knows.GUTFELD: No one knows, but Trump always did, you know, he said the nice things and then he did the tough things. But you don't wait until a country is rubble and you have four million refugees, you know, out, you know, around, it's a sad state of affairs. I don't know.To think about the Russian side, we tend to rule things out, they don't rule things out. You know? That's their thing. But I don't have confidence in Joe. I don't think he has an original thought. He might -- he is good at saying good job to other people in the room but he can't just say, come on, man to Putin when he's not even there or he doesn't take your calls.So, I think the one thing he's got to say, this is when my expertise comes in, stick to one essential truth. The invasion was a clear violation of international law. Don't start talking about protecting liberal democracies because places like China and Russia they don't draw that line. It's not that important to them.WATTERS: Yes.GUTFELD: But they do understand violation of international law. You can't get around that statement.WATTERS: Borders.GUTFELD: Borders. Rights. Sovereign countries, blah, blah, blah and don't bring up regime change. Just say, you know, I think that would be a good start but I'm not an expert. I think we need to get an expert.WATTERS: Dana, you are an expert.DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CO-HOST: I don't know, I'm not an expert either. And I don't know what's going to happen.WATTERS: Yes.PERINO: I don't know like cases are going to become -- become in front -- in front of the court so I can't answer anything.GUTFELD: Yes.WATTERS: Do you think he is going to go over there? You always talk about when you over and do these trips having deliverables. What will be the deliverables when he touches down and does this big meeting?PERINO: Well, one thing was, so when they were discussing the possibility and Poland wanted to send the MiGs to Ukraine to be able to use. That apparently was signed off by Blinken. Kamala Harris was going to go and make the announcement and it was going to happen and the night before or day and a half before, Biden changed his mind.Now that might be fine and we might look back and say he probably, maybe that was a good decision. But they sent her there was nothing and then she didn't have a great performance, but that's typical, so then she has nothing to say -- to deliver.It is interesting how he wants to be the leader of the free world, but he's also been in the backseat. He was dragged into the sanctions by Europe and by -- and then by Congress, right, on the oil part of this equation. So, what do they deliver here? If they can deliver some sort of way to say we have intelligence that says Putin is going to draw back and say that partial victory because they're not going to be in NATO. Is that a way to end things? OK, fine.If Ukraine says if that happens, we got to have some sort of security guarantee for our people so we can rebuild this place, can Biden to that? Yes, maybe, that might be something he could do. And then the other thing that they have to do is figure out a way to collect more intelligence on Putin's plans because that is actually been something that our intelligence community has done very well.Penetrated into the Kremlin and they are confused, they are not sure who is telling people what and so I will continue to try to drive that wedge if they can, I'm not talking about regime change but letting the generals know that, like we're on to you and you are losing these many people and it could even be more than that.WATTERS: Do you think the Russians have little spies that are going to be scurrying around this NATO meeting, Judge?PERINO: Interesting.WATTERS: Like the waiter?JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS CO-HOST: Well, that's what they --WATTERS: A Russian comes over with some Perrier, he's listening to everything?PIRRO: Probably, that's what they do.WATTERS: Yes?PIRRO: That's what they do. But look, I saw pictures of Mariupol today. And it looks like it's completely devastated. And I couldn't help but think, and this is to Greg's point. You know, here we are four weeks into this. And now, all we've heard is Biden talk about the fact, they are going to use chemical weapons. There's going to be a cyberattack. There's going to be nuclear weapons. And it's all about what Putin is going to do.But then we say, look, we don't want to get involved. I understand that. We don't want to get involved, but at the same time, you could have been delivering a message of, hey, buddy, --PERINO: Yes.PIRRO: -- we got the same things that you have. And pushback with, you know, we can do the same kind of thing. We've got offensive stuff to do too, as opposed to saying everybody, he's got all this stuff and you better run under your desk right away.And you know, when we're not looking, they are not looking to have us have boots on the ground, but I still don't understand. And the sad part is when I saw Mariupol today, why not the S-300, why not the Patriot? And someone said, I hosted Laura show last night, and someone said, well, you don't know, they may already have the Iron Dome there. And so, it doesn't look at --WATTERS: He'll have that.PIRRO: -- the place is being destroyed. And so now the demand and the final shoe that's going to drop is famine. Ukraine provides 40 percent of the world's wheat? We got four million refugees, there is no heat, no water, no food, no wheat, now what are we going to do? Go over there and just look at Putin, and say, gee, you know, he can't do this anymore?We got to provide money to rebuild, we've got to take care of the refugees. Maybe a world global famine now out in terms of food? And I keep going back to my thought which is this, get the NATO country to stand there with Zelenskyy with three leaders every day. Get the pope.If Pope Francis is upset about it, Pope, with all due respect, stand there with Zelenskyy. Get the Russian patriarch the great Orthodox Church, as well as the head of the great Orthodox Church. Have them all stand there in one place.WATTERS: Part of me thinks that the west wants this proxy war to kill Russia finally because it doesn't look like they were making that big of an effort to cut a deal and make Putin leave and save any face whatsoever. It's all about sanctions and just grinding him down.JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I don't know. It seems like a pretty tremendous effort has been made. When you consider the fact that the Russians have lost 15,000 troops so far which is more than they lost in the war in Afghanistan. They have soldiers regularly turning themselves over to the Ukrainians. They're suffering from frostbite, they're frozen. They don't have the appropriate equipment to do this.The sanctions have been incredibly difficult, obviously for the everyday Russians but have hit a lot of these oligarchs who apparently turning left and right on Putin. There was a rumor I don't know if it has been confirmed yet, that one of his very high-ranking generals has actually turned around and said I'm not interested in this.And in terms of real on the ground deliverables, Jake Sullivan was briefing the press on the plane heading over to the NATO summit. He said that the U.S. is coming with more humanitarian aid which is something they desperately need, and also refugee assistance.And that's where I feel like the U.S. has dropped the ball in all of this. It's something insane like only 11 Ukrainian refugees have been allowed in since this war started. They're only basically letting people who were here before the war started stay. And that's a huge dereliction of duty. You cannot have what's going on with Poland, whether taking millions and millions and millions and not step up to the plate there.Calling it a war crime, big deal from Secretary Blinken today. And also, I wanted to mention that Madeleine Albright passed away today as well, which is incredibly sad event. I don't know, I was thinking of Blinken talking about war crimes and then Madeleine Albright have been through.Anyway, I think that we are doing a lot. And I think that the intricacies and how complicated this is to unite western countries, we all say we're united. We're all democracies. We are very different types of countries who get our gas, our oil, our food from very diverse places. And I think that Biden is doing a hell of a good job actually in keeping the wheels running on this. And we'll see what he says at NATO but the Ukrainians are getting a lot of help from us.GUTFELD: We should send them to our southern border.PIRRO: Yes, let them in.GUTFELD: Yes.WATTERS: Let them right across.GUTFELD: Let them right across and then we get them on the planes, right?WATTERS: Yes. Give them some cash.(CROSSTALK)PIRRO: Fly them in --PERINO: I read this story last week that the Ukrainians that were there that went to the border were allowed -- were being allowed in and the Russians were not.GUTFELD: Jesus.WATTERS: Very hypocritical. Straight ahead, it's the media Supreme Court protection plan. The press rushing to bash Republicans and praise Biden's nominee.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PIRRO: Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson back for another marathon round of questions today on Capitol Hill. Jackson being pressed by Lindsey Graham about her sentencing in child pornography cases.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): You think it is a bigger deterrent to take somebody who's on a computer looking at sexual images of children and the most disgusting way is to supervise their computer habits versus putting them in jail?KETANJI BROWN JACKSON, U.S. SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: No, Senator, I didn't say versus.GRAHAM: That's exactly what you said. I think the best way to deter people from getting on computer and viewing thousands and hundreds and overtime may be millions of a population of whole of children being exploited and abused every time somebody clicks on is to put their ass in jail.(END VIDEO CLIP)PIRRO: But don't worry the mainstream media has already rushed to Jackson's defense as lashing out at Republicans for daring to ask the judge questions about her own record.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOY REID, HOST, MSNBC: The word I would use for Tom Cotton was thuggish. I thought Lindsey Graham was screaming and weird. Josh Hawley, ridiculous.UNKNOWN: I mean, quite frankly, it looked like I saw Ted Cruz commit a hate crime.UNKNOWN: That line of questioning which was so grotesque from Lindsey graham.UNKNOWN: Republican grievance signaling, RGS.DON LEMON, HOST, CNN: It's amazing to watch someone who is a, quite frankly, an intellectual giant be questioned by people who have really no idea about the law.(END VIDEO CLIP)PIRRO: All right. So, you know what, I'll start with you, Greg.GUTFELD: Yes.PIRRO: The judge in a further explanation of her going under the guidelines for child pornography said, you know, the fact that it's on the internet, which most judges would see it as an aggravating factor and the statute says you can consider it as an aggravating factor, she doesn't think it is.She said because, you know the statute was drafted before the internet. What I find so incredible is that she is so willing to look for every excuse she can to get out from under sentencing guidelines as it relates to child porn. And the more we dig into this, the more it's clear that she would rather have a probation officer check a guy on his computer than put him in jail when the guidelines recommend jail.GUTFELD: I would say she is soft on crime. Did I answer that question?PIRRO: Yes.GUTFELD: Thank you very much. I want to talk about Don Lemon referring to Judge Jackson as an intellectual giant. To be fair, compared to Don, a plastic garment bag just screaming in the wind isn't intellectual giant. Yet the media is so much in the tank for this candidate, they should wet suits and snorkels.WATTERS: I like that.GUTFELD: But to be fair, this whole, this is how it works, right? There is a lot of grandstanding. One side of the media becomes the critics and the other side becomes their cheerleader. And then it switches and then, you know, we become nicer and they become angrier.But we were told by the media, that this would be a historic choice, right, after all she is a black woman. But how do you know that she is? The media, they are not biologists. We need to employ a biologist to check every historic choice that is based on identity. I have no idea if Judge Gorsuch is actually a white libertarian, do you? We have a Black female.WATTERS: It could be.GUTFELD: We need a biologist to check the stuff.PIRRO: All right.WATTERS: I'm not a biologist.(CROSSTALK)PIRRO: So, let me go right --GUTFELD: Jessica got to throw up --PIRRO: Let me go right to Jessica with that. You know, I really thought that, you know, she ideologically, she first into the court, she's replacing Breyer. And then all of a sudden, she's asked by Senator Marsha Blackburn to define what it means to be a woman. And she basically said she can't. And then thinks, and she says, I'm not a biologist. What's the problem there?TARLOV: Well, Marsha Blackburn was on earlier today with John Roberts and he asked her to answer her own question and she would say I am a woman. I am a female. Now, Judge Jackson certainly could have gotten that answer up. But that wasn't what she's after.(CROSSTALK)PIRRO: But she didn't.TARLOV: But it wasn't what she was after. It was a got you question because she wanted to talk about Leah Thomas and she wanted to talk about trans athletes. And Judge Jackson, rightfully so, I believe did not want to get in the dirt and have that fight with people --(CROSSTALK)PIRRO: How is that dirt?TARLOV: How is --PIRRO: That maybe the case that they may decide? How is that dirt?GUTFELD: And it's in the water.TARLOV: It's a squeaky-clean example. It was playing into Marsha Blackburn and the fact that she showed up and did not have a good answer prepared. Because I know that you would want more than that. What she wanted was Judge Jackson to say something about born biologically female, that someone who is born with a vagina, whether they then transition and become a man later in life, someone with a penis.PERINO: But it's kind of interesting that she -- that Judge Jackson said we need -- I'm not biologist. Because is it about biology? I thought maybe it's not about biology. I thought that's what we were talking about. I mean, we all know what was going on there.TARLOV: Right.PERINO: And that --(CROSSTALK)TARLOV: And she didn't want her hearing to turn into screaming matches about the war culture points --(CROSSTALK)PIRRO: So, we're going to give her -- we're going to give her credit for not answering a question?TARLOV: I actually think that with the hearings that we have seen recently, yes, I want to give her credit for not degrading herself to having a fight about these woke culture battles, yes. I do want to give her credit for it because I have full confidence that Judge Jackson thinks that people who watch child porn are bad people and --PIRRO: Well --TARLOV: -- that she could muster and answer of I would say I'm a woman, I would say I'm a female.PIRRO: Yes, but she didn't, and that's the problem. Because she didn't have the cajones obviously which is Geraldo can say --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Well, we should ask a biologist.PIRRO: Yes.PERINO: I mean.PIRRO: I mean, and even child pornography, I think it's despicable but I'm going to go under whatever the prosecutor says, whatever the statute says.(CROSSTALK)TARLOV: But she --PIRRO: Because the internet wasn't there. Well, the internet was there. But Jesse, why don't you finish this up.WATTERS: If that's a got you question, what is -- are you are rapist? That seems like a got you question to me. She should have been able to answer that question, Jessica.(CROSSTALK)TARLOV: Do you think anyone --WATTERS: Anybody can answer that question smoothly. If she is that brilliant, spin it. Say, you know what, I was born a female because I have biological female parts but this is a complicated issue now in the United States of America and gender is influx because of this and that and the other thing.You're done and then that's how you scoot through.TARLOV: Next up is --WATTERS: The fact that she couldn't answer that question it makes me think maybe she's not as brilliant as everybody says she is because that's a slam-dunk question and everybody knows it.I also don't like this thing. The Democrats breathed fire at these Republican nominees, really nasty stuff. But someone ask her what the definition of a woman is and the media rushes in and starts giving chest compression, they were like, they're trying to save her from near death.These things are so stacked. You had Republican nominees accused of rape, sexual harassment, bigotry, racism, sexism, everything. And Democrats don't even give them like a little sympathy vote. All of these things are so over on the other side.GUTFELD: Right.WATTERS: It's crazy.PIRRO: All right, Dana.PERINO: Well, I just wanted to add, I was going to make some media bias point but you did it so well. I am going to leave that there. I don't think that -- I don't think that they prepared well enough for this child porn issue on the Democratic side or at the White House when they were doing the mock hearings. I don't think they saw it coming and I don't think they're handled it all that well. I think that there are a lot of people who say obviously this is ridiculous and the Republicans are blowing this out of proportion.However, parents aren't going to see it that way. They're not going to hear it that way and parental involvement in their children's lives is the a, number one issue in all of these swing districts and the swing states. So, let's just say you're in a tough district and you thought you were going to run on the fact that Joe Biden had just nominated and confirmed to the Supreme Court the first black woman and this is going to be something to be celebrated. It is.However, you also know you are going to have to take a tough vote because now you are going to be labeled as soft on crime just like Judge Jackson. That's how those ads are going to run and this is going to play well into the midterms.PIRRO: Well said, well said. All right. Next, Democrats are following the political science in changing their tune on COVID mandates.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: Warnings of a red wave seemed to have scared the White House into shifting its COVID messaging. The administration planning to no longer look at cases when recommending masks, and will instead focus on hospitalizations and deaths.And to no one surprise, the party seems to be pivoting against the mandates that they once championed. The Dem in charge of midterm messaging now saying it's completely over mask mandates. And comedian Bill Maher warning that his party, the Democrats have gone too far.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL MAHER, COMEDIAN: California has got to get its arms around this issue. I mean it just does. What, first of all, we know there has been exodus from this day and that's part because of high taxes and it's partly because piracies and it's all year around, but it's also because people can't (muted) do anything.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Jesse, Bill Maher sounding more and more like me, which I'm OK with.WATTERS: Yes.GUTFELD: He influenced me, now I'm influencing him.WATTERS: You think so?GUTFELD: This all come full circle.WATTERS: Has it?GUTFELD: Yes, we go to bed and breakfast now and against. That's all right.WATTERS: OK. Do you go to bed?GUTFELD: No.WATTERS: And breakfast.GUTFELD: Yes, after breakfast.WATTERS: I get nervous about something --GUTFELD: What?WATTERS: -- when we say the word red wave.GUTFELD: I know.WATTERS: Let's not say that.PIRRO: Yes.WATTERS: Let's not jinx ourselves, ourselves.TARLOV: I'm not part of your group.WATTERS: So even the airlines aren't taking mask that seriously anymore. I flew to Florida and back over the weekend. I didn't even have a mask to get down there. I had to ask Johnny to get me a mask. So I had one of my pocket, I get to JFK, and I don't even put it on. That's my new thing. I don't put it on until someone tells me to put it on. And no one told me to put it on until we actually boarded the plane. So I kind of was putting mine on and Emma didn't put it on at all. Not very compliant. And she was scolded, but gently.And then when we sat down, we put it on for takeoff. And then we, you know, you nibble it your peanuts, and you take your drink, and that's the scam and they don't remind you the whole flight.PERINO: Why are you telling me that's a scam.WATTERS: No, I've mentioned the scam before. So I trashed it when I get to Fort Myers and then you're good for the rest. So I'm back in Fort Myers on the return trip. I find that it's all crinkled up in my pocket. I don't put it on, until I get on the flight. I did put it on for the Delta lounge because I wanted to make a good impression. But when I get onto the flight JetBlue was a little bit more persnickety.They are and it wasn't a personal announcement. It was the over the intercom announcement. I felt I was being targeted because I was in the first row and they saw me but again, you put it on then you cheat with the peanuts and then you throw it away when you land in JFK. This thing is over.GUTFELD: Do you know what I love? I love laugh -- I love laughing at people who are leaving a flight and leaving the airport with their mask on. You can take it off the moment -- the moment the doors open and take it off because what are they going to do? Kick you out? You won't be right. So that's means 50%, 50% of the people in the airport do not have to wear masks because they're leaving. They get off for God's sake.PIRRO: So used to wear it all the time. I agree with you. I think JetBlue is a lot more persnickety.WATTERS: They are.PIRRO: But Delta is wonderful about it.GUTFELD: I disagree. Delta -- I had a flight attendant that was a complete prison guard.PIRRO: Well, that -- prison guard?GUTFELD: Yes.PIRRO: Well, maybe she knew you from your other line.GUTFELD: That's true. I smuggled in a lot of things.PIRRO: OK. You know what, you know, what's crazy about this? I just want to say one thing. Like, three months ago, if we didn't have a mask on, we were killing granny, right? And now because they see that the Republicans, I won't say red wave. We may be ahead, they're like, oh, forget about it. No, there's no problem. No stress. Hey, it's a free country.GUTFELD: Yeah, it's true. You know, Jessica, that's the problem. I've said it before. It's got to be weird to be at a party that only makes choices based on the political ramifications, as opposed to right and wrong, Jessica. You should be ashamed of yourself.TARLOV: Yes, Democrats are the only ones who want to win elections at any cost. There has been new information that has come in, in the last few months beyond the polling of a potential red wave. And that's what happened during Omicron in terms of how many people were dying from it versus getting it and how important it's give you people out of the hospital versus having it and I did have it a few weeks ago, and it felt like I was legitimately sick, I'm vaccinated, boosted. I didn't have to go to the doctor or hospital about it. But the person I think has been the most interesting on this is the governor, the Democratic governor of Colorado, Jared Polis, because after the first wave of mask mandates went away, he never brought them back. So everyone was bringing them back for Delta and then for Omicron. And he just said, no, it's done here. He had never understood outdoor mask mandates. And actually gotten a little fight with the governor of New Mexico, because New Mexico brought the mandates back, and he just said, I don't see the science behind this.And then they had basically equal numbers of problematic cases as New Mexico. And he just said, there's your evidence for you where --PIRRO: It doesn't work?TARLOV: It doesn't. I think that it did -- it did work. And I don't want to say that what people did at the beginning when we didn't have a vaccine for this. And when people were dying, and we saw the 970,000 people that have died, belittling it down to, you know, peanuts, and like a joke is, I think, doesn't --GUTFELD: How dare, yes. By the way. I mean, we've been talking about this forever, Dana, that it should have been about hospitalizations and deaths, you know, and we're still asking little kids in New York.PIRRO: This is an outrage. It is outrage.PERINO: Yeah, the health guy was like, you're not going to wear masks forever. Thankfully, Mayor Adams like actually no.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: They are not going to have to do that, made it optional, but I thought this was great. Matthew Foley of the Free Beacon. He went into it all of Capitol Hill, and he found out that none of the Democratic offices in the House and Senate are operating, none, none. OK, so they are continuing to use this COVID thing as an excuse so they can work from home and work my district.I have to tell you this, Catherine Cortez Masto, she is a senator from Nevada, Democrat in a swing state. She's got a tough race coming up. She has a sign on her door that says this, cleaning not necessary, because no one's there. And I think the Democrats they've realize like they've got some problems here. And it's not just mask mandate.WATTERS: But the numbers are going up, Greg, and I think this summer if we have to go back to boxes, I think we should go back.PERINO: On Fridays at least.GUTFELD: Fridays at least. Yes, we're all going to be doing THE FIVE from our homes again. That was fun, huh.All right, coming up. An 87 year old vocal coach dead after a random attack on the streets of NYC with a suspect stood around and watched as the ambulance came crazy.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Horrific, new details in a murder case, 26 year old Lauren Pazienza, excuse me, charged with manslaughter after allegedly shoving an 87 year old vocal coach from behind in an unprovoked attack. Prosecutors say that after pushing the victim to the sidewalk and leaving her there bleeding from the head, the suspects spent almost a half hour in the area and even watched as an ambulance came to help. Pazienza turned herself in after fleeing to her parents' house on Long Island for two weeks and deleting all of her social media accounts. Judge, what is going on here?PIRRO: Well, OK, she's charged with manslaughter in the first degree, which means that she intended to cause serious physical injury and the woman died. Now, the tide turns. We don't know what caused this. What instigated it, not as though, it's not like there's a justification. But the witness cyclists who saw this apparently saw this Lauren, cross the street, the 26 year old and then call her name that began with B and then shoved her from behind.The Prosecutors allege that they -- she shoved her from behind, the 87 year old victim falls and almost bleeds out, ends up dying five days later in the hospital. This Lauren, the 26 year old, the tide turn, when she didn't go to help her. She didn't call the police. She instead has a fight with her fiance seven minutes later, she stands in the background like any criminal or returns to the scene of the crime, watches the ambulance come, does nothing and does all of that stuff which shows consciousness the guilt.So here's the question, will she be convicted of manslaughter and the second degree for which, you know, she faces a manslaughter, first, she faces 25 years, possibly. But the jury is going to be asked is a push enough for death. She's not charged with murder, they may end up with a crim neg. I'd like to know what's wrong with this 26 year old, what her motive was. But anyone who understands criminal law knows the motive is irrelevant. She pushed her, she shoved her. The woman died. That's the clear and tenseless she shoved her. And, you know now the defense attorney Arthur Aidala who's excellent, guy's brilliant. He's saying, you know, she shouldn't even be, you know, in jail. She apparently is going to be bailed on a half a mil.PERINO: OK, because, well, partly because her parents can help her out. She went up to her parents' house. She was hiding for two weeks, and she deleted all of her social media.TARLOV: Definitely looks like she was involved in this. And I also don't have any kind of legal background as the judge here. But that question of you know, is a push enough, doesn't -- it matter if the person died from the push?PIRRO: Well, yeah, you take you take your victim as you find them. So if you push the 30 year old guy, he might not have died, you push an 87 year old woman, she die. But you pushed her and that is a homicide. That's why that's a manslaughter. This is definitely a manslaughter. We're not charging over the assault. You know, the question is, I mean, it's just take a baseball bat to hit her. That's intentional murder.PERINO: Right. But the thing is like, so in New York, we've had this surge in crime. And Greg, we've seen some of these cases, like, the woman gets pushed off the subway, and it has, in a couple of the cases, it's been a homeless man or somebody who isn't mentally ill, and deranged and maybe let out of prison and is hanging around there without bail. This is very different.GUTFELD: I think that's why it's so -- we're so curious about it because the perpetrator, it doesn't fit what we've seen over and over again, which is an unhinged homeless male. That's all it's been happening. But I was wanting I have a question for the judge. Because like, in this case, it seems like the odd the object of the assault, the woman dictates the severity of the crime. It's like if she pushed Jesse or me, we would have been like, what's that? Right. But she puts a female in her late 80s. And that in her push then becomes like the murder weapon. Is that going to be part of the defense that it's like --PIRRO: Absolutely.GUTFELD: Yeah.PIRRO: What we have in our criminal justice system is the mens rea test. What is the intent of the individual? And that's what, you know, you always try to tell jurors when they come back and say, well, how do we know what the accused intent was? You determine it by the circumstances or, you know, how they handled themselves. But it's not just the resulting crime. It is, you know, you've got to get in her mind.PIRRO: All right, Jesse, any thoughts here?WATTERS: You want to know what my biggest fear is?PIRRO: What?WATTERS: Punching someone in the face, they fall and they crack their head open and die.GUTFELD: That's your big --WATTERS: That is my biggest fear. Because then you're now looking at a long time in prison.PIRRO: I had that case when I was DA, kids in a drunk -- they were underage drinking. Friends, one punches the other, hits his head and dies.WATTERS: What happened?PIRRO: A nightmare. They came back -WATTERS: Two charges?PIRRO: No, they came back with an assault to because he didn't intend to kill him.WATTERS: Well, why did she get this then?PIRRO: Because it was a shove. And it was --WATTERS: She's 86.PIRRO: Yeah. And you take her how you find her? I mean, she's definitely frail. I mean, these are two kids in played football.PERINO: Is there any indication that she -- that the perpetuator knew each other?PIRRO: That they knew each other? No, we don't know that. It's strange.PERINO: Because he did call her something. happened beforehand. Like she calls her a name and then she --WATTERS: The B word.PIRRO: But she crossed the street. That's what the witness said, the 26 year old across the street.PERINO: To get to her.PIRRO: Get to her and call her name. Who knows?PERINO: All right. Thank you, Judge. We're glad you're here with that expertise, so right ahead more drama for Kamala Harris, yes, we have more. New details about the growing rift between President Biden and his VP.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)TARLOV: New reports of friction between President Biden and VP Harris, the latest claims from a new book detailing how Harris felt disrespected when White House aides would not stand for her as she entered a room like they normally would for Biden.And the Vice President was reportedly furious over the photo that Vogue used when she was featured on the cover wearing Converse sneakers. But Biden's team told her to back down because it was, \"a first world problem.\" We don't have a ton of time. So I'm going to lead with the example I care about most which is the Vogue cover. And I agree with her on this. I don't know Dana, what you think?PERINO: I don't -- I know, here's the thing. She posed for the photograph in the outfit. And I know that they were -- oh yeah, we'll probably use the other one whenever they maybe they thought they had assurances but when you don't -- you don't control the editorial of the photoshoot, you don't. So if you don't want to be filmed -- and just wanting photographed wearing your sneakers on the front page of Vogue don't wear them, don't ever do it and that you could blame her staff if she wants to blame somebody else. Don't blame Anna Wintour, whatever. She should blame her staff. If you want to look a certain way you have to dress a certain way.The other thing is, I don't -- I'm just trying to remember, I don't believe that you stand for the Vice President when he enters the room. I know -- I don't, I love Dick Cheney. I don't believe we ever did. If it was -- if it's just him if the President's coming in with him. Yes, you do. But no, I don't think so.TARLOV: Judge?PIRRO: Couldn't agree more if you don't want to be photographed in converse and that the pants suit. Don't put the man for the shoot. Don't pose for the shoot. Tell him I'm not wearing this. I've done that before. You say no, I'm not wearing this. OK. And nobody needs to stand up for you. You're not that important. That's enough.TARLOV: Well, she's kind of important -- she's like second most important in the world.PIRRO: Well, no but she -- nobody in the White House is standing up for her, she's upset that they're not.PERINO: I'm pretty sure they didn't stand for Joe Biden when he was Vice President.TARLOV: Right, would you stand?GUTFELD: No offence, Jessica but this is when I wish Geraldo was here. Because at this point, he would go, when I was on the cover of Playgirl and they show the cover of Playgirl. He goes, I was shirtless, and I wore these leather chaps. I didn't want to wear the leather chaps. I wore them anyway, but I didn't complain because it was a decision I made with the leather chaps.TARLOV: Well, good news, Geraldo back next week, you can feature the story again. Or he could go topless. Jesse?WATTERS: Thank you for putting Geraldo a leather chaps in my brain. Nobody is right. You know, you don't go nude for a photoshoot. If you don't want your whole naked body on the cover of Vogue or Playgirl?GUTFELD: Yeah.WATTERS: Yeah, and Anna Wintour is usually right. Isn't she always right about everything? So you don't argue with Anna. My favorite thing about this thing --TARLOV: I don't argue with AnnaWATTERS: The VP staff floated the idea of maybe starting to oversee relations with the Nordic countries. Maybe some low risk. Nordic countries instead of the Nordic -- the Northern Triangle. She wanted to go to Oslo and Copenhagen. Yeah, to start off slow.PERINO: I saw that.GUTFELD: Which is started with Nordic track.PERINO: What were their issues that she was wanting to deal with? I don't understand.WATTERS: Yeah, yeah. And apparently the White House laughed at that.TARLOV: OK. I still think that that photo should not have been on the cover and it could have been embedded in the shoot. It could have more serious.PERINO: The thing is, I would own it, would be like, I look good and converse.TARLOV: Well, she does but that --PERINO: It's complaining.TARLOV: All right.PERINO: She own it.GUTFELD: She's on Vogue. Come on.WATTERS: OK.PIRRO: Melania Trump was.WATTERS: Yeah.TARLOV: One more thing is up next.GUTFELD: Exactly.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: It's time now for One More Thing. I'm going to go first with the feeding frenzy. Lester's Fixins Variety, he's got a whole variety of soda pop. I tried, I said soda pop. Flavors: peanut butter and jelly soda, beacon soda, ranch dressing soda, sweet corn soda, buffalo wings soda and pumpkin pie soda. I'm going to begin with the sweet corn soda.GUTFELD: Oh, geez.WATTERS: Oh god, it's like syrup.PERINO: I'll try the peanut butter and jelly. But I brought, so I'm going to try the ranch just because I'm dying to see somebody's face after they drink that.WATTERS: Man, I can't. It smells stronger than it tastes. You guys have to try some buffalo wings. You want some buffalo wings soda, Judge?PIRRO: No.WATTERS: Come on. Play along.PIRRO: I won't do it.WATTERS: Play along, Judge.PERINO: Just smell it, just smell it.PIRRO: Pumpkin pie.WATTERS: Pumpkin pie soda.PIRRO: I don't like pumpkin pie.WATTERS: Pumpkin pie?PIRRO: Anything sweet.WATTERS: All right, some Pumpkin pie.PERINO: Give the bacon one.WATTERS: All right, Greg gets bacon. Jessica get ranch.GUTFELD: It's all right, I'll -- you know what, I'll pretend.PIRRO: Yeah, pretend.GUTFELD: There you go.PIRRO: That's pumpkin.PERINO: Yeah, my tastes like peanut butter and jelly.WATTERS: Try the ranch, Jessica.PERINO: Good job Lester Fixins.GUTFELD: What is this?TARLOV: That's a horror if I may.WATTERS: Try it?TARLOV: No.GUTFELD: No, it's like bacon grease.TARLOV: You know, I can't.WATTERS: Try it.PIRRO: This is mine, why can't you, Jessica?WATTERS: It's a religious holiday. Jesus.TARLOV: Get it through liberals, I'm on a juice cleanse. I have 10 pounds left to lose, getting burn is a thing.PIRRO: Look great.WATTERS: Juice cleanse, exemption. We'll give it to you. Dana, you're last.PERINO: All right, so today is National Puppy Day and you think I'm going to show you a picture of Percy. But I'm not. This is kind of special thing for me Canine Companions for Independence. You might remember spike the dog that was raised by a puppy raiser here named Jennifer Williams who has moved to California for love. But they named a puppy after me. Here's the taste of it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JENNIFER WILLIAMS: I want you to meet Dana. Hello puppy Dana. Hi, sweetie. I'm going to raise her and one day she's going to grow real big and be a servant.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Thank you, Jen for that and it'll be fun watching her grow up. I really look forward to hearing her say, drop it, Dana.PIRRO: Yeah.WATTERS: Judge Jeanine?PIRRO: No, Dana.PERINO: Yes.PIRRO: OK.

Hello everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Judge Jeanine Pirro, Jessica Tarlov, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5:00 in New York City and this is THE FIVE.President Biden's Supreme Court nominee Judge Kentanji Brown Jackson facing a marathon session of questions during her confirmation hearing. Judge Jackson being pressed over her judicial philosophy, liberal beliefs and alleged soft on crime stance. Republicans taking issue with sentences she handed out for child pornography cases.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KETANJI BROWN JACKSON, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: Judges have to consider things like the victims and when I was talking about making sure that victims, circumstances are heard, it was about my sentencing practices that I --SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): Well, still victims being heard with respect.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Republicans promising to keep things civil but saying there is a glaring double standard at play.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): There are two standards going on here. If you're an African-American conservative woman you're fair game to have your life turned upside down, to be filibustered no matter how qualified you are, and if you express your faith as a conservative all of a sudden you're an effing nut. And we're tired of it and it's not going to happen to you. But it just appalls me that we can have such a system in America.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: All right, just on clarification on that. So he was talking about Janice Rogers Brown. She was a nominee that President Bush 43 put forward and in 2005 and 2006 she was filibustered for two years. She was a black conservative judge and there were members of the Senate at the time and Biden was on the judiciary committee who did not want to put her forward because one of the people said, anonymously of course to the paper, that they did not want a Republican to be in a position to nominate a black woman to the Supreme Court because they wanted to do that themselves.That's what that was all about. She was a very qualified judge. Miguel Estrada same thing, Hispanic judge. This is in 2005, 2006, and then those nominations failed. All right, judge, on the soft on crime issue or on judicial philosophy what did you take away today?JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS HOST: I think she still hasn't indicated what her judicial philosophy is. She talked about her methodology and her method -- she is -- so her methodology is unusual. Number one, she says she goes from a position of impartiality and then she hears the arguments from both sides and then she decides. Well that's what every judge does. That's, you know, that's nothing new.But I'll tell you the thing that bothers me is those who defend her based upon her sentencing of the consumers of child pornography as not recommending, by the way, no mandatory minimum and, you know, the fact is that she talks about victims but she doesn't really talk about the fact that these young children are forever in a position of being -- living forever in images of being sexually molested on the internet among pornographers.And her position is well, you know, for the first offender they really -- there shouldn't be a mandatory incarceration. That's her judicial philosophy when she was on a sentencing commission and she's gotten away with that and I think it's a little too easy. And I don't like the fact that, you know, she says I talk to the defendants and tell them about the harm. Talk about the victims who really suffered the harm.And she continuously goes through that. And when the truth is if you possess child pornography, she doesn't want to sentence them to time. But if you receive it then the law says you must give him the minimum but she undercuts it. I haven't heard anything about her sentencing at the high end so she is a classic public defender.PERINO: Did you want to answer that, Jessica, to comment on that part.JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. She is a public defender. I mean, that was her job and that's how she sees things and I don't think -- I think that the attempt to have some sort of conversation about Judge Jackson being someone who thinks in any way that child pornography is okay or that it is a huge injustice or something incredibly terrible that happens to the kids that are featured in this is just a big failure.Today I just saw a lot of people talking about the things that they wanted to talk about, you know, with the CRT, talking about Gitmo detainees with John Cornyn saying that, you know, she said that Bush and Rumsfeld were war criminals when that's just how a habeas corpus petition is actually filed. That it says the name of the defendant v Bush and then, oh, why did you call them war criminals.You should know first of all how those petitions were. You should know that that was just the formula. It seemed like they were trying to land a lot of big booms or whatever you want to say it is.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Big booms.TARLOV: Big booms. And it just wasn't working. She's been very steady and I understand it hasn't been an electrifying hearing but she seems to be answering everyone's questions and --PERINO: On the child porn sentencing issue she had several days to prepare an answer. She had a prepared one at the very beginning. Let's go to call for number one if you could. This is her answering a question from Durbin I believe.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JACKSON: There's a statute that tells judges what they're supposed to do. Congress has decided what it is that a judge has to do in this and any other case when they sentence. And that statute, that statute doesn't say look only at the guidelines and stop. The statute doesn't say impose the highest possible penalty for this sickening and egregious crime. The statute says calculate the guidelines, but also look at various aspects of this offense and impose a sentence that is \"sufficient but not greater than necessary.\"(END VIDEO CLIP)PIRRO: And that's exactly the point. That she is looking at these cases as not meeting even the minimum sentencing. She is indicating that Congress didn't tell me that I couldn't go below it so I'm going to go below it. That is not recognizing the danger, the harm, the sickening nature of what children are forced to do and forced to live with throughout their life with those photos being among child pedophiles.PERINO: Yes. And she did talk about the victim statements and things like that, but Jesse on this or on any of the other issues, it hasn't been the most fireworks of any hearing we've seen in the recent past.WATTERS: No, this is not the Kavanaugh hearing for sure and if she wants to just blame Congress for everything then she should just run for president because that's what presidents do. She's going to be a Supreme Court justice. That's a cop-out. Blame congress? Judges have wide discretion with regards to sentencing.And Ted Cruz held up a sheet with all these cases of child pornography and every single case she sentenced below the guidelines and below what prosecutors had requested. That's a pattern and that's a scary pattern because why. Why would you sympathize with people who possess child pornography?And when she was asked why she says oh, it's Congress' fault. That's BS. I'm also disturbed by she sympathizes with Gitmo terrorists. Now in the one case she had to defend the guy because she was a public federal defender, I get that. But then she goes into private practice and writes an amicus brief in support of a Gitmo terrorist.She chose to do that. Now why did she do that? You know what her answer was? She blamed her law partner.PERINO: Yes.WATTERS: So this is just an excuse-making machine that Joe has nominated to the highest court and I'm not that impressed. She's polished. She can definitely conduct herself well at this hearing, but I don't know if she's a left-wing loon or she's a mainstream Democrat. I have no idea.PERINO: Yes.WATTERS: These people hide their true character very, very well so you don't know what you're getting, but you do know when a Democrat nominates a justice that justice never sides or swings with Republicans. Half the time these Republican nominees they get in and then they go to the left and they go to the right and at least.I guess you could say they're independent maybe, but you just get hardcore stamp it left every single time these people get nominated. So, that's probably what she is. I think we can assume that.PERINO: Greg, do you -- oh, sorry.WATTERS: Well, I was just going to say the Kavanaugh stuff really left just a horrible taste in my mouth.PERINO: Yes.WATTERS: Remembering what that was like accusing the guy not only of rape. They trotted out Avenatti and accused him of gang rape.PIRRO: Right.WATTERS: And then if you ask her a question about rape, you're then destroyed like this guy Holly. They destroy Holly for asking about rape. That's all this is. Anybody that obstructs a Democrat nominee is destroyed. And if you are a Republican nominee then you're destroyed. That's the game.PERINO: Also, if you think about the Amy Coney Barrett hearings, remember they -- the accusation about her was that she was going to overturn Obamacare. And then that -- and she -- the case comes before her and the case is -- she rolls on the merits and Obamacare is upheld. So all of that, all the things that Amy Coney Barrett went through were -- that was unnecessary.GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes, yes. This was a --PERINO: What do you think?GUTFELD: This was a powerful, powerful hearing. I didn't watch it. I didn't see a single moment of it. I had no desire to hear -- I mean, we know what happens with these things. If you're a Republican nominee you'll be accused of being a rapist. If you're a Republican questioning a Democrat nominee you will be called a racist.So either you're a racist or you're a rapist and these smears only go one way. The worst thing a Republican calls you is that you might be soft on crime. Ouch! But should they -- should they go hard on her? I don't think so. You know the Republicans suffer from the Gutfeld law of inevitable failure, meaning even though they know that the outcome will result in something they don't want, they're going to do it anyway.It's because you prefer the predictable story, the predictable storytelling loop, right, even if you end up on the losing end. We know she's getting confirmed yet we got to play our roles. We got to waste everyone's time and set you up for failure later. I prefer to keep your powder dry, right? Well, first, I would love to have a confirmation fast forward button.You know we know the votes are there so why can't one of the senators just go push a button and just go okay we're done already because the bottom line is you're not rolling over if you're being polite to her. It's living to fight another day so when you get an opportunity to nominate somebody you can look back and you can go like, this is what we did for yours, now try to do this for us.So it's picking your battles. Why pick a battle, why pick a battle that you know you're going to lose? You know what, it's just a waste of time. Just - - let's get through this, move on to something else.WATTERS: You're asking politicians to turn down an opportunity to grandstand.GUTFELD: I know. I'm an idiot.PIRRO: There's one other thing that's very important. She's not willing to talk about her judicial philosophy, but she's willing to talk about her sentencing philosophy. She was on a sentencing commission for federal statutes and she said that she supports the elimination of mandatory minimum for first-time offenders who distribute child porn. She does have a philosophy. She goes in the favor of the criminal who's convicted of possession of child porn. Why?GUTFELD: Yes.PIRRO: Tell us why.TARLOV: Because it's not going to be a winning argument against this woman and she doesn't care about child pornography.GUTFELD: She's going to win.PIRRO: Oh, she's going to win that, but --TARLOV: Two things really quickly. One, I remember no issues about Neil Gorsuch, first of all who was confirmed at a highly polarized --PIRRO: Well, that's (inaudible).TARLOV: Well, I'm just saying when people say this is what happens it's not just what happens and I don't know what would happen, you know, if Republicans had a nominee up and they received a letter and I know the process was completely terrible of the congresswoman to Dianne Feinstein, but that their nominee had been accused of sexual assault.I don't know what they would do with it but I would hope that they would consider it carefully. Second point, when you say we don't -- this is how Democrats do, Republicans so polite. They wouldn't even see Merrick Garland. They wouldn't even interview the guy go to his office or have him visit them to hear what he was all about.GUTFELD: You see him now though. They had a reason not to see him.PIRRO: Yes.GUTFELD: I mean what a joke, right?PIRRO: Yes. More terrorist since we were parents.PERINO: Okay. Straight ahead, as Russia destroys entire cities, President Biden warning about what Vladimir Putin may do next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: President Biden issuing a new warning about Vladimir Putin as Russia continues to target major residential areas and level cities.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Putin's back against the wall. He wasn't anticipating the extent or strength of our unity. And the more his back is against the wall the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ. Based on evolving intelligence, Russia may be planning a cyber-attack against us. As I said, the magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Truly inspiring. New footage shows Russian strikes hitting a factory in Mariupol and drone video capturing just how bad the destruction is getting. Jesse what is your take with Biden's response? It just seems so lackadaisical and does it help -- and the reference to chemical weapons, what do you make of that?WATTERS: Eventually, Russia will use chemical weapons against -- who is writing that? That's not the president talking. That is someone handing him a note and him reading the note. He doesn't know what he's saying. He's just reading it. It's very frustrating.So we've -- did you hear what Zelenskyy said over the weekend? He basically called the United States a big tease.GUTFELD: Yes.WATTERS: He said that we have been privately telling them they're never going to be a NATO.GUTFELD: I know.WATTERS: But then saying in public, yes, you guys got a good shot. And I'm not blaming the United States for Russia invading, but if you're going to show these guys lag and then all of a sudden he comes in and you're going to say, oh, it wasn't my fault. I mean, my goodness.I don't know if it was the fact that we dangled the NATO in front of Ukraine to force Putin's hand or if Putin saw Biden's disaster in Afghanistan or if maybe if Biden hadn't won the election and Trump was in there, he wouldn't have gone in. We're done with that now, okay, but --GUTFELD: I'm not. I agree with everything you're saying.WATTERS: But we are -- we are done with that now so here we are. And here we are. We're in a proxy war. And we are funding this proxy war in Europe. And Putin allegedly his back is against the wall. So in someone's corner they do desperate things. We could see a chemical attack. We're already hearing about a massive world recession. We heard about that on the elevator today with the Fox (inaudible).TARLOV: We did.WATTERS: So, Biden is now playing a chess game. Do you trust Biden's brain? We're a couple chess moves away from, I don't know, a hot war with Russia or a world recession. I don't trust this guy to manage this situation. He has shown no ability to manage anything, inflation, the border, nothing. And he's just reading notes that someone handed to him about what's going to happen next. I'm a little nervous.GUTFELD: Jessica, are you nervous? I'm nervous.TARLOV: Yes. We're all nervous.GUTFELD: Jesse's made me very nervous right now.TARLOV: Well, I'm still processing that we showed them a little NATO leg or something and they --WATTERS: Zelenskyy's words not mine.TARLOV: Okay. Biden is having to coordinate with all of the leaders of Europe who frankly have more of an opinion about this than we do because they rely on Russia in a different way and they live right there and we're over here.And I think that he's actually done a very good job diplomatically in terms of strengthening NATO, keeping everyone on the same page. I, judge, I see you. I fell you.GUTFELD: You can actually hear her eyes rolling.TARLOV: I felt it. Yes. And I used to be the biggest eye roller --PIRRO: I didn't move. I did not move.WATTERS: I just dropped my pen.TARLOV: Can I just say -- there are a couple of things that have happened though in the last 24 hours that I think are meaningful. So, Makariv, which I may be mispronouncing, 60 miles west of Kyiv was just liberated. The Ukrainians have raised their flag there.We saw that there's a report that there is no longer train tracks connecting Belarus into Ukraine and that was probably Belarusians trying to stop the Russians. That's a very good thing seeing as how they were a strong ally there. Now, we don't know exactly how the actual death tolls of what's going on in terms of Russian troops showed up on Pravda which is a pro-Kremlin outlet.GUTFELD: Yes. It's like 10,000 Russian troops.TARLOV: Ten thousand. Complete -- the accurate portrayal of what the Ukrainians are saying the Russians had lost. There are little chinks in the armor falling apart here that I understand why there are defense officials who are saying, you know, what has Russia actually gained in these 26 days? Now we've lost a lot of lives and that obviously matters, but at the same time I think there's a lot to be hopeful about.GUTFELD: What do you think, judge?PIRRO: Well, I want to spin off of what Jesse said when Biden talks. He said \"The Ukrainians have every piece of equipment that makes rational -- national sense,\" okay. But all Biden is doing is he's in the talk stage. He says it's clear -- we have clear evidence that Russia has committed war crimes and that they can use chemical weapons and they're prepared to do a cyber-attack and they've used hypersonic rockets. This is everything that Biden has said.But what's Biden's conclusion? That there's going to be a new world order and we've got to lead it. Are you kidding? How do you get to that conclusion? But what I see happening here is what Jessica was saying. You've got these little wins that the Ukrainians are winning back, a small town.The Ukrainians as far as I'm concerned are in the lead right now because first of all Putin thought that he was going to enter Ukraine and they were going to greet him like, oh, thank God, he's here. He's going to save us. They want no part of him and it's totally different from, you know, being - - from his thinking, he's going to run it.Even if he levels the whole country of Ukraine, he's not going to be able to run the country, occupy the country. So now, Putin is not going to be able to win a piece. It's up to Zelenskyy to try to say this is what we've got to do. We're not going to capitulate. This is what we will do. And it's all about diplomacy now.GUTFELD: Yes. It's interesting. I think Zelenskyy said he's ready to talk ceasefire and some of the things, I mean, dropping the demand for full NATO. That was there at the beginning.PIRRO: Right.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: Yes. But Putin still went in. So then you have to wonder then, what are Putin's real motivations? And would anything have been provocative because he keeps saying well, that will be provocative, and that will be provocative. So, Biden has a chance now to go see NATO face to face and perhaps figure out a way to show a little bit of more strength if that's what we're looking for.But there is something to be said about the west. I don't know whether it's just us or the Brits or maybe the French helping but our intelligence and our ability to penetrate into the Kremlin surprised Putin. We actually found out that the mid-level generals didn't know that the war was about to happen when we did. So there's something that's to be said about that.And also this point about him saying that he could use chemical weapons. One of the things they've done, it's a strategy that we'll look back on and say, was that good? Was this good? It seems good now but we don't know looking forward. We have said he is likely to do this. He's likely to do that.On the chemical weapons point, if Putin does not use chemical weapons, Biden could say that was a deterrent. If he does use them, then they could say you can't blame it on anybody else. You can't say that it was Assad or something like that. That would have happened on your watch. The last thing I would say is there is a possibility that the Ukrainians are going to end up with another problem which is too many Russian POWs. And then we're having a whole other conversation so the crisis continues.GUTFELD: There you go. Ahead, Kamala Harris, speaking of crisis, just embarrassed herself again. Well that's just the beginning of her problems.PIRRO: Vice President Kamala Harris being mocked once again for another doozy of a word salad statement. This time, Kamala was giving a speech about affordable internet access.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The significance of the passage of time, right? The significance of the passage of time. So when you think about it there is great significance to the passage of time in terms of what we need to do to lay these wires, what we need to do to create these jobs. And there is such great significance to the passage of time.(END VIDEO CLIP)PIRRO: But the VP's problems don't end there. A new book revealing a feud between Harris and the White House with Biden's communication director reportedly blaming the VP for her missteps and toxic work environment and not the tough assignments she's been given.Okay. Now, I suspect, Greg, that you understood that word salad because I didn't get it.GUTFELD: You know what's funny? If I didn't know any better, I would think that she took a bong hit except she lacks the depth of a competent stoner. It was as if she read the transcript of a robot pretending to be high, right? Those jets is amazing thought in her head, and there's this incredible gulf between what she believes in her head to be awesome and then what everybody hears, which is nonsense.She doesn't know, she doesn't know how it sounds. But she deserves credit for one thing, she lost her 10th staffer, which means she's just completed the staff punch card, which entitles her to firing an 11th staffer at no extra cost.PIRRO: You know what, we can't have someone on the international stage, you know, whether it's about the border, Ukraine. I mean, the woman couldn't even answer a question as to whether or not we take refugees, Jessica.TARLOV: Yes. Let's just say my name for 30 seconds. That was --GUTFELD: Dreadful?TARLOV: -- being on the stage with the President of Poland when he's facing hit like 3 million refugees in one day. And the uncomfortable laugh, which obviously has become a bit of a running joke about her was definitely more upsetting to me than this passage of time. But there's no question that there's an issue here, her popularity is low. It's well below Joe Biden's.And what I have heard in defense of the staffers that are leaving, it's not that the staffers are not qualified. Apparently, there's a refusal to read the briefing books as completely as you should before you go out there and give these kinds of press conferences or meeting with other world officials. And so, I feel for them and there is natural turnover and we all know that. And so, not everyone is leaving because they, you know, they hate it and they need new opportunities and campaign cycles, et cetera. But there's no question that it is very believable that Biden's people and Harris's people are at odds with one another.PIRRO: Jesse, you want to talk about the palace intrigue about Biden's people and Harris's people?WATTERS: Well, I found out that Dr. Jill doesn't like Harris. And I know if your wife doesn't like someone that you're friends with --GUTFELD: Tell me about it.WATTERS: That's done. That is officially done. I did some estate planning and, you know, you got to set things up for your spouse or your children, in case God forbid, I get stabbed by a vicious homeless man. Not out of the realm of possibility that your -- it happens, and it's about protecting the people that you love in case something horrible goes wrong. And Joe Biden is an older guy. He's almost 80 years old. And when you pick a vice president, it's almost like you're doing estate planning. You know, you have to protect the country, if God forbid, anything happened to you.So the fact that Joe Biden selected Kamala tells me, he didn't do any estate planning. And he doesn't care actually about the country as much as he should. Because to leave America in her hands, if God forbid something happen to Joe, would be beyond a dereliction of duty.Now, I have to assume that that was a teleprompter glitch because why did she just repeat the phrase six times? She has to be just reading the phrase over and over again in the teleprompter, right?PIRRO: It's not the first time she repeated a phrase over and over.TARLOV: That was not a teleprompter.WATTERS: So she --WATTERS: I thought this was Ron Burgundy.PERINO: Do you --WATTERS: No, I thought she was Ron Burgundy and she was just reading what was in front of her over and over again.PIRRO: All right. Wow. OK. You know what I think?WATTERS: (Inaudible) convince that there's doubt there.PIRRO: Dana, you know what I think? I think that Joe Biden really did do some estate planning, because she's his insurance policy. No one is going to look to get rid of Joe Biden because they know what they're going to get it by way of impeachment.PERINO: So it made him look better.PIRRO: Yes, yes.PERINO: You know, that's actually very -- I don't think of that much strategy went into this. Now I think that we all know what happened when he was deciding who he wanted. And he said, OK. Look, he didn't look at her and say, she would be the best counselor for me when I'm in the middle of a big decision. She's going to be the best person for me to go out on the stump and give a great speech.Now, they patched up after that debate where she basically called him a racist. That's why Dr. Jill Biden has never really forgiven her for that. But also, you cannot -- she wants to be president, and you cannot bluff your way through the vice presidency. And extemporaneous speaking on the speech team, you have to fill a -- you have to do a five to seven minute speech. And it feels to me like she's trying to get to that seventh minute, by adding all sorts of words that don't even make any sense.The other thing I would like to do is to say, let me give her the benefit of the doubt on something as well. They have set her up with three things in the recent memory that did not work out. So they told her go fix voting rights. They gave her no evidence that there was voting rights problems that she could turn to, and they never going to have the votes. So they gave her admission that she was going to fail.On the border, they didn't give her any policy change recommendations that she could go forward with, so she was like, OK, actually I'll just go do root causes down in Central America. And the third thing is, she went to Poland and she didn't have a deliverable. So if I were the chief of staff for the President, I would try to figure out what my problem is to try to help her.PIRRO: All right. Ahead, car-free Sundays, the insane new ideas liberals are pushing to counter surging gas prices.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: A new level of climate insanity taking root while prices at the pump crush the American people. The International Energy Agency has put out this ridiculous 10 point plan to help reduce global oil demand. Ready? Some other absurd suggestions include cities going car free on Sundays, traveling by train instead of flying, and only allowing people to drive private cars every other day.So, Greg, if you want to go to San Francisco, I think a train maybe the best options.GUTFELD: Oh, I'd love to do that. Imagine how pleasant that would be an Amtrak to drive across the country.WATTERS: Yes.GUTFELD: I meet so many interesting people and probably get killed by them. How do these draconian measures affect people in the city? It's just to punish the rubes in the sticks in the suburbs. Most city folks don't need cars, none of this absurd austerity has an effect on them. They're basically forcing people that they look down on to solve the problems that they cause, trying to create a 10 point austerity plan for people who live in the city.No more pizza by the slice, right, huh? That's costly. They'd have to buy it in bulk. You can only use food delivery once a week, if you can have the cook at home the whole time. You know, you usually get paid more if you live in the cities, we need to slash the salaries and use that money to explore alternative energy.So the salary should come back down to maybe what people make in the suburbs. We do know that there's more crime in the cities but I think to save on costs, we need to shut off the 911 phone service during the weekends, perhaps the hours between 4:00 and 7:00 am during the week. Imagine the kind of savings.WATTERS: Imagine, Dana?PERINO: Well, it's amazing how the administration will turn themselves into a pretzel, in order to avoid exploring for more oil and gas. It is just absurd. And truly, if you want to invest more in alternative energies, you know mostly who's doing that, the oil companies. And I mean, that's -- they have the money to do it. And look at any of their portfolios, they are doing that.WATTERS: They are doing that and that is what they are doing.GUTFELD: That was very Kamala Harris.PIRRO: Kamala like.WATTERS: Americans don't like austerity. A lot of us don't know what that word means but we don't like having to reduce our freedoms in order to sacrifice for something, after we've sacrificed so much over the last three years with COVID.TARLOV: True.WATTERS: Judge, so what do you think?TARLOV: So, I was watching Bill Maher this weekend, and he had on Obama's former Energy secretary who has an organization, a think-tank with Bush's former Energy secretary. And they have something called the Green Real Deal, which they feel is this consensus building approach to taming climate change. Now, they agree that climate change is manmade, all the normal Democratic platform points, but they are emphasizing using our natural gas capabilities and using nuclear energy to help us get to the place that we all say we want to go in 2050.And it feels like those kinds of conversations when people are not going to not take their car on Sunday, or whatever it is, are more realistic. And I think that people can decide to do those things themselves. But when you hear these things from the people up on high, who are probably not living that way themselves, it just aggravates people.GUTFELD: Precisely.TARLOV: So, have some --WATTERS: What is this agency? Is this a UN thing?GUTFELD: I never heard of it.TARLOV: The IEA?WATTERS: The IEA, yes.PERINO: No, it's International Energy, yes, IEA.WATTERS: No, they're associated with the United Nations probably.PERINO: I don't think so. I don't think so.GUTFELD: It was founded by Old MacDonald.WATTERS: Well then, where do they come off telling us to stop driving?TARLOV: It's just an advice.PIRRO: But here's the thing. I mean, it's mimicking what the Democrats want to do. And the totalitarian instinct is very strong with the Democrats. They got used to it, and they feel bad, COVID was almost over, I think it's over. COVID is almost over and now they want to tell us what to do.Here's the thing, the one that really gets my attention is they want us to use a night train instead of a plane. Now, I can see myself coming back from Chicago or a speech, coming into Penn Station at 3:00 in the morning. You know what, now I can be a crime statistic but they won't be using any airplane fuel. I mean, come on, stupid.WATTERS: Oh, so stupid. And how do you spell that?PIRRO: S-C-O-O-P-I-D.WATTERS: All right. Coming up, chaos at Spring Break. Cops looking to crack down after a surge in shootings.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)TARLOV: Welcome back. Spring Break mayhem taking over Miami Beach.Gunshots sending crowds of people running for cover. The city declaring a state of emergency in response to the violence. That (inaudible) mayor putting a midnight curfew in place and cops are saying enough is enough.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RICHARD CLEMENTS, MIAMI BEACH POLICE CHIEF: Gunfire was 10 feet away from an officer that was on an ATV, that had to dive off of his ATV in order to get behind it because he didn't know where the gunfire was coming from. That's a problem.(END VIDEO CLIP)TARLOV: So that's definitely a problem. We're just saying this happened last --PERINO: Well, I was just saying like we covered this story in 2020. It was like a whole thing because no one wanted to wear a mask, et cetera. Then last year, they had the same problem. So I don't know what you do if you're in a city that has become a destination for this kind of thing like that. I feel sorry for the police officers trying to figure it out.I know everybody wants to go down and enjoy the great weather and the freedom in Florida, and have a great time. But this seems a little bit over the line. I do wonder if Jesse is going to send Johnny to Miami for a spring break package for Primetime.WATTERS: I told John if he gets shot at Spring Break to film it, and because if he doesn't film it, it didn't happen.Tonight on \"Primetime,\" we're going to be doing a look back at what spring break used to be like ah. Remember just about body shots, not actual shots to the body, real beer and jello, and wet t-shirt contest.PERINO: What a tease.WATTERS: And remember, MTV was involved and then, you know, I got involved. And now people are shooting each other in Miami. What has happened, and we will find out tonight on \"Primetime.\"TARLOV: That's a great plug for the show.GUTFELD: Yes, yes. I was going to say that usually the shots would come after spring break. But anyway, because you know --WATTERS: So dirty.GUTFELD: Yes, it is really bad. Yes, it looks more like a prison break than a spring break. But I'm telling you, if there is crime and I hate, you know, I hate crime. I would prefer to be at spring break because I won't be at spring break. It won't be in my neighborhood, so I'll take it.WATTERS: That is such a bad thing for you to say.GUTFELD: I know. I know. I'm a selfish little man.PIRRO: But York City and, you know, it's like spring break here every day, three years --GUTFELD: I got three years of crime.PIRRO: Yes. You know, the only thing that I can think of is like, you know, the two people who got shot that I read about were both women. And, you know, the problem women used to have was, you know, they tripped on their heels or whatever, now, oh, I got a bullet to my, you know, to my right clavicle. I got, you know -- it's like -- it's crazy town. I don't know what they're going to do --WATTERS: Were the women the intended targets?PIRRO: Well, if they were shot by someone who was a sharpshooter, I suspect they were the intended targets.GUTFELD: I like that you do your research for your show during THE FIVE. Judge, tell me --WATTERS: Greg, at least I watch the hearings today.GUTFELD: Yes, I've watched nothing. You're right.PIRRO: OK.TARLOV: \"One More Thing\" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: All right. It's time now for \"One More Thing.\" I got a little plug, the paperback edition of my book \"Everything Will Be Okay\" is on sale now. And I wrote a new section, a new chapter about dealing with COVID -- well, post-COVID life and work, so that's in there. And if there's a little promotion, you can -- if you want to sign book for your graduate or your loved one, if you go to the Little Point Bookshop, your copy will be personalized if you order them by May 1st. So littlepointbookshop.com and that will happen.And I am doing a new podcast series. And Judge Jeanine is going to be on my podcast. If we can schedule it, we're working on that. All right, Jesse.WATTERS: All of your plugs have little plugs there.PERINO: Yes. Hello, plug.WATTERS: Because you're so little.PERINO: Got it.WATTERS: I had a nice weekend in Naples, Florida. We raised some money with a great group of people, Russ and Tracy Scurto (ph), and Joe and Amy Novogratz (ph), I think threw down a lot of money in donated to Bret Baier's All Star Panel Event Benefit, which everything goes to the Children's National Hospital. So thank you guys so much for everything you guys contributed.We had a great time. And Jesse Jr. had a great time and we're at the Ritz, there he is (inaudible) by the golf course. Just almost free as a bird.And then, last night we were at Sebastian Maniscalco at Madison Square Garden. In case you were wondering where I was on Monday, it was not my birthday. I don't take my birthday off like Greg does. But I was just, you know, laughing the whole night.GUTFELD: Watch me off.PERINO: It's a great show. Greg.GUTFELD: All right. Let's do this. \"Greg's How to Surprise a Cat: Part 3.\" All right, there's nothing better than surprising a cat. I could watch this video over and over again. Let's show you.This is how you surprise a cat. You place the cat in front of a toaster, and you wait. By the way, there's no injury on the cat. The cat is doing fine. In fact, the cat is now in business school.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Yes, it's amazing. How like a little bit of a shock and change somebody's life for the better. Oh, there you go. I'm telling you. I've watched that 700 times.WATTERS: He don't need any more MBAs.PERINO: Jessica?TARLOV: That was -- I'm not a cat person but that was a very cute cat video.GUTFELD: Yes, it was because you hate cats.TARLOV: I'm also very allergic to add.PIRRO: Are you allergic to dogs?TARLOV: No. Thank God. Dogs are the best, OK.GUTFELD: This is beautiful.TARLOV: We have a lot of times so, OK. California man was trapped for two days 15 feet underground, in a narrow steam drain. The unidentified man entered a 16 inch wide opening near San Francisco for no apparent reason, and then couldn't get out or go back the way he came by. By some miracle, people passing by heard his screams, helped called 911.It took at least 50 firefighters who worked for hours to save him. Obviously, he was very happy to be above beyond -- above ground again. Learned lesson, do not go places you're not supposed to go, though, I don't know who would jump into a steam drain.GUTFELD: I could give you a few --PIRRO: (Inaudible).WATTERS: San Francisco --GUTFELD: San Francisco.PIRRO: They did that for a reason.GUTFELD: Yes. It was --PIRRO: Nobody does without a reason.PERINO: Well, we don't know reason.PIRRO: We don't know the reason but it -- he wasn't doing it for his health.PERINO: Could we speculate on a reason, just kidding. We will not do that. Judge, yours is next.PIRRO: OK, all right. Listen, it's my turn. One more thing, I'm hosting Laura Ingram Tonight again at 10:00 pm Eastern Time. Make sure you tune in. We've got a great show tonight. We got Senator Lindsey Graham. He can talk about everything he talked about at the hearing today.But my one more thing is that the top ballet performers dance for Ukraine in a charity event. Ballet dancers from across the globe dance side by side to raise funds for Ukraine, about 20 of the world's top dancers perform before a packed auditorium at the London Coliseum. Some of the dancers have loved ones in Ukraine and found it impossible to just sit by without lending a hand.The charity event was called \"Dance for Ukraine.\" Gala and ballerinas from Russia, the US, Brazil, Italy, France and Japan participated. All of the dancers donated their services and they raised $184,520 for Disaster Emergency Committee's Ukraine fund. God bless them. Everybody's upset about what's going on.PERINO: Do you like the ballet?PIRRO: I love the ballet.PERINO: Do you know about Jesse's cousin?PIRRO: What's your cousin?WATTERS: He's a professional ballerina.PIRRO: And is he in the American Ballet Theatre (inaudible)?WATTERS: Yes, highly accomplished.(CROSSTALK)PIRRO: Ballet dancer.PERINO: That's it for us. \"Special Report\" is up next. Hey, Bret. Is it ballerina, Bret? I don't know.BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hey, guys. Hey, guys. Hey, listen, thank you so much for everything you did for Children's National. And Jesse and Emma only have five more dinners to do so.WATTERS: That's true.PIRRO: Yes.PERINO: Wow.BAIER: Thank you very much.PERINO: Have a good show.BAIER: All right.

      "  This is a rush transcript from \"The Five,\" March 18, 2022. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro along with Jessica Tarlov, Jesse Watters, Dagen McDowell, and Greg Gutfeld. It's five o'clock in New York City, and this is THE FIVE.Vladimir Putin putting on a propaganda show for the Russian people as he brings more death and destruction to Ukraine. The unhinged dictator holding a rally in a Moscow stadium boasting about the success of his invasion in Ukraine despite a massive loss of Russian troops. Putin claiming it was justified.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This is what genocide is all about. It is precisely to save people from this suffering, from this genocide that is the main reason for the convincing motive and goal of the military operation that we launched in the Donbas and Ukraine.(END VIDEO CLIP)PIRRO: Mike Tobin is in Lviv, Ukraine with the latest there. Mike?MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Judge, the relative peace of the western part of this country was shattered this morning as the sirens whaled and four cruise missiles slammed down perilously close to NATO's eastern flank, the target of these air strikes was the Lviv state aircraft repair which customizes MiG-29 so they could be used by the Ukrainian air force.Maksym Kozytskyy who is the regional administrator of Lviv says six cruise missiles were launched over the Black Sea by long range bombers. Two of them were intercepted, four of them made their way to their target. The Ukrainian air force says that Russian X555s with a price tag around $1 million apiece.It's a desperate situation down south in the town of Mariupol where the Donetsk regional drama theater was being used as a bomb shelter. It was clearly marked that there were children inside. It was still hit by Russian aircraft anyway. As many as a thousand people were inside on both the first floor and in the basement. We got reports yesterday that some people got out.Today we are hearing from a politician down there that the rescuers who are attempting to free the people trap in the rubble are being fired upon by the Russian forces and cannot even get to the wreckage to get people out or determine the extent of the casualties.Mariupol itself has become an apocalyptic scene with 80 percent of the housing there destroyed. The people there are resorting to mass graves simply because they cannot handle the logistics of how many dead they have on their hands.The people in that town are leaving. But the humanitarian corridors, they say, are not holding together. The people are desperate enough that they are fleeing under fire, quite literally, running for their lives. Judge?PIRRO: Mike, thanks so much. All right, guys, you know the juxtaposition of the mass graves and the killing of children and the inability of people, you know, to even wait in line without getting, in a bread line without getting shot, it's just amazing.So, you've got all we've heard about Putin hiding. Now he's out with about 2,000 people in and around that stadium. And you kind of wonder, is he copying Zelenskyy now, or did he think he needed to shore up support? Is his country -- does he need to let them know they're in charge?JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: There was the anniversary of the Crimea invasion. So, you have to held a big rally. It was a fake rally. The BBC had a team of reporters inside and said most of these people were public sector employees that were forced to go there by their employer.A bunch of the younger people were told they didn't even know where they were going. They said we're going to send you to a concert. And we'll let you go to the concert if you can have off for the day. So, they went and they found out it was a Putin rally.One guy gave a quote to the BBC, he said I'll be here for a while and then I'll leave. I think most people here don't support the war, I don't. And the BBC said most people felt ashamed and embarrassed to be there.So, I do feel bad for the Russian people. It's like having your father be a career criminal. It's humiliating and there's nothing you can do about it. And now he's going out there and acting like it's 1945 and just lying his way through a war in 2022.You can't do that. You can't lie about a war in this day and age. It's just impossible. And how humiliating must it be for Vladimir Putin to have to tell all the people around him, these are the lies that we're going to tell and you have to taste my food because I'm so paranoid, you all hate me, I think you're going to kill me. That is an insane way to run a country. He must be a complete psychopath to rule a nation in this day and age like that.PIRRO: Well, anyone who says they're going to demilitarize a country because of Naziism when the president is Jewish, I mean, he's not so, to begin with.WATTERS: Preposterous.PIRRO: But, Dagen, I want to ask you this. When he was speaking to that crowd, he quoted the bible. He talked about Russia prevailing. And, you know, against a nation without Naziism. And he stirs up this Russian nationalism. Does this suggest that he is in all the way to the end? That there's no way -- he's not stopping. And that it's a fight to the finish?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The only way this ends quickly is if something happens to Putin. Like a brain aneurysm. I'm not -- I'm not joking and I'm not going to talk about -- well, I'm going to use the word assassination but that's the only way that it ends.And by the way, since the annexation of Crimea, the ruble has fallen because of the sanctions. It hasn't come back. Russians are poor since then, there's visa restrictions. There's less prosperity in the country. But you still -- their fidelity to Putin, particularly among older Russians, has not completely been shaken because Russia, since Putin took over, it was a kleptocracy after the fall of the Soviet Union. It was ruled by criminals. You would get shot in the streets.So, Russia is in better shape than it was. And there is this deep nationalism. And a willingness to endure and suffer. Again, Starbucks closing is not a hardship in Russia. In terms of -- I don't want to get too off track. But the Russian people are in part cut off from information because of our technology grades, Google and Apple.They caved to Putin last fall. They were wildly ignorant of what he was capable of. And they, Google and Apple got threats from Putin's -- his strong men. And they took down an app that was designed to get Russians to register protest votes against Putin that was backed back opposition leader Alexi Navalny.Apple started configuring iPhones to make it easier to promote Kremlin- backed social media com -- companies. And also in Russia, you still don't have access to this Apple security tool. It's a feature designed to make internet undetectable. Apple won't offer that to Russia. And so, they are essentially doing Putin's bidding and again, so much for the freedom of this technology grade.PIRRO: All right, Greg, one person who has gotten outside of that is Arnold Schwarzenegger. I want you to take a listen.GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS CO-HOST: I never heard of him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FMR. GOV. ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (R-CA): Ukraine did not start this war? Neither did nationalists or Nazis. Those in power in the Kremlin started this war. This is not the Russian people's war. This is an illegal war. Your lives, your limbs, your futures are being sacrificed for a senseless war condemned by the entire world.(END VIDEO CLIP)PIRRO: Go ahead, Greg.GUTFELD: Best work since Conan, I think. I'm not -- I'm actually not kidding. This is, you know, I thought it was pretty impressive. It was very persuasive. It was incredibly well written. And it was also -- we've been talking about this idea of face saving and status preservation. And that's what he did for nine minutes when he was talking to the Russians and talking to Putin because Putin follows him on Twitter.PIRRO: Right.GUTFELD: He has 22 people in one of them. So, the -- when you have to talk -- when you're talking to this country with a deep history, you have to talk about you're a great people. I love you. He was so polite, so polite and he also referenced his own flaws. Dad's a Nazi, woops.PIRRO: Yes.GUTFELD: He kind of -- he went overboard on January 6, but he did that -- not for us. He did it for Russia to say, hey, look, we have our problems too. And I'm going to call out January 6, but I'm going to call out this as well.So, I thought it was persuasive. So, I go and text Alana, my wife. She's in Warsaw. I go, hey, what did you think of that. She said it was great. It was -- the thing that she loved about it was it was polite because it made her cry in a way but to see -- how in a weird way naive we are to think it would actually matter.And I go like, I go, you don't think it would move the needle or have an impact. And she just responded with a number of laughing emojis and a capitalized no. And I thought to myself, I go, like, you know what, this kind of thing, we believe as Americans has an impact. That's the best celebrity video you're ever going to get when you think about it.But it's like, but Russia -- they didn't grow up with freedom of speech. They don't -- they don't have -- that's the thing that's not in their blood. So, whether this has an impact on them and persuades them, I don't know. The people it does persuade are already there. Young people who have access to the internet, social media in the city.PIRRO: Right.GUTFELD: They already get it. But in terms of everybody else? I don't know. But I still thought -- I mean, I have friends of mine who think it's going to have a big impact. But the Russians who are, to use your phrase -- what did you write? Ashamed and embarrassed? They are all ashamed and embarrassed. And they're so pessimistic. You know, I go, this is great. They're going, Greg, it's -- it's -- it's too late. You know? For our country. They were like, so -- they're sickened.PIRRO: All right, Jessica. If the west is serious about stopping Putin and, you know, his so-called stopping of genocide in the Ukraine and the celebration of taking Crimea, how can they do it?JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it seems that they are making pretty good headway here. I mean, everything that you hear out of this, not out of Putin's mouth, but everyone else's mouth, so U.S. intelligence officials, U.K. intelligence officials, the Poles, what you hear from the Ukrainians, Zelenskyy and his team, is that, they are holding Russians at bay. They have lost thousands of people. He has committed war crimes. Those are huge travesties.But if you think back to how petrified we were about that convoy. Remember that was outside of Kyiv.WATTERS: Yes.TARLOV: And it was nine miles longer, 13 miles long. And now it's nothing, right? We don't hear about that anymore. What happened in Mariupol, which I hope I pronounced correctly. Huge tragedy. I'd love to see that the prime minister, he said we're rebuilding that hospital because that's where the largest amount of Greeks are in Ukraine.When you see the three prime ministers coming from other NATO countries and sitting there with Zelensky in Kyiv, that's important. And when I watch the Putin speech, what I saw was just a man alone. He has no allies to come and stand next to him. There are four or five countries, right, to back him up.He couldn't even get the Chechnyan leader to show up to stand there with him. And he couldn't get people from the former USSR.WATTERS: Scheduling conflict.TARLOV: And, I -- I don't want to say I feel good about democracy's chances here. But it really does feel like it is the entire world against this man. And what we have to do and why the rhetoric of the video like what Arnold Schwarzenegger made I think could matter is decoupling nationalism for Russians from Putin is the important rhetorical trick here.Because he is not representing national interest. These are people who have been oppressed from the get-go. And we have to turn the tide on that. And every little bit. If someone sees that video and they pass it to their moms and activates those moms -- I mean, the Russian mothers have played a hugely important role in keeping Russia on a good path. And now that they are getting a chance to face time their kids who have been sent over to Ukraine not knowing where they're going, I hope to see more of that kind of activity.PIRRO: Yes, you know what, I think --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: But we need to decouple Putin from the money that's funding the war. And when you have --(CROSSTALK)TARLOV: These sanctions are hugely effective. I know we can do more.MCDOWELL: -- two-third -- two-thirds of Russia's economy is not sanctioned, Jessica. Not any energy transactions.PIRRO: You know what, guys --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: And that's on Europe. That's on Europe.PIRRO: One -- one of the things that I think is important is something that you mentioned. And that is, with the -- we've got three NATO leaders who were with Zelenskyy right now in Kyiv. If we were able to have those three NATO leaders, just more leaders every day along with the patriarch from the Russian orthodox religious community, from the Greek orthodox religious community, stand there with Zelenskyy, with all of NATO, all the religious leaders, that would have a profound effect on the world in terms of this is diplomacy, you're going to bomb us, you're going to bomb the churches and you're going to bomb the leaders of NATO. We dare you.TARLOV: And then you're going to get your nuclear war.PIRRO: Well, we'll see. I don't know.TARLOV: If that --(CROSSTALK)PIRRO: Anyway, coming up, President Biden talking tough about Russia in a meeting with China. But will the commis (Ph) actually listens?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: President Biden threatening consequences before his big phone call with China's president today, warning the communist country against helping out Russia's invasion. But now that the call is over, the White House says President Biden did not make any specific requests of China. But, instead, laid out his assessment of the situation. Great.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNKNOWN: President Biden wasn't making specific requests of China. Why not? I mean, given the stakes here.JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Because China has to make a decision for themselves about where they want to stand and how they want the history books to look at them and view their actions. And that is a decision for President Xi and the Chinese to make.UNKNOWN: Can you offer any explanation for why the U.S. still has concerns after this call?PSAKI: Because we'll continue to watch until we see what actions they take or don't take.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Jesse, in scientific terms, that is called a garbage answer. I mean, are they not taking this seriously? There's a two-hour phone call and they didn't talk about how to influence Putin, but just make an assessment. What the hell is going on? I mean, what a waste of time.WATTERS: I can't believe she said, the Chinese have to decide --GUTFELD: Yes.WATTERS: -- how they want the history books -- China writes their own history books. It's not like a world history. Come on, Jen. I'm like, that seems to be like the pressure point. That's what they say about Putin. That's what they say about Cuba. The history books. The history books. What about right now?GUTFELD: Yes.WATTERS: I don't know how well Joe did on that call. But I don't think he did very well. They give him notes and he looks and -- he's not a commanding presence. So that made me nervous.He has a pretty easy task. China screwed up. They hitched their wagon to a loser. There's no way Russia wins this thing. And China looks really bad now. Xi is screwed. He prestige on the line for Putin. He's supposed to be this big statesman, right? This big, you know, rising power.And now everyone is disgusted with his boy, they're disgusted with him and he's got to try to like slowly back out of the jam that he's in. And he gets on the horn with Biden. Biden probably let him off of the hook. He should have been much tougher. I'm sure he wasn't tough. I wasn't there. But I'm surmising, he wasn't tough enough. You got to separate these two weasels, the Russians from the Chinese and you do that with tough talk and threats and you do it with economic threats. And I don't think Biden played that card.GUTFELD: No. Dagen, we worry that, you know, Russia is going to be tethered to China. But doesn't China need America and Europe more than it needs Russia? I mean, we buy so much from them. Russia doesn't buy much of anything.MCDOWELL: China knows that we're suckers and we're soft. Not all Americans, but that we are dependent on their cheap imported goods. And the Wall Street Journal phrased it as, because this is not just China and Russia. This is China and Russia and India and even Saudi Arabia that is trying to move away from a western-dominated world. In terms of power, in terms of economic heft.I call it the -- on your show on Monday the rapid-fire realignment of world power. It is the Journal described it, the editorial page as a union of a nations that are hostile to democracy, economic freedom, and U.S. leadership. And even China is lining up with Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia won't take Joe Biden's calls, but Saudi Arabia might agree to China paying for its oil in -- the yuan.China gets natural resources from Russia, period. And it will be a huge engine for China's growth. And in terms of our softness -- we run up our debt so much, 130 percent debt to GDP, we don't have the money to take on China at this point.We're so soft that the Democrats in California are sending $400 checks to people to offset the high gas prices and people who don't even have cars or drive get them. We're not able to stand and cut off supplies from China. We're --WATTERS: I would have done something -- I'm sorry. I would have said, listen, Xi, or however you say his name, I would have said, you're not getting any more visas. No more Chinese are going to come to this country and steal our secrets and rip off our intellectual property.GUTFELD: Yes.WATTERS: And if you just supply arms to the Kremlin, that's what happens. Because that's their whole economy. That's the only way they survive.GUTFELD: What do you think, Jessica?TARLOV: I think Jesse stole time from me and the judge.GUTFELD: You will get it back in the second half.TARLOV: I will get it back.WATTERS: In the Hunter segment.TARLOV: Yes.GUTFELD: You get the talk all during Biden.TARLOV: All right. This is more of this feeling. OK. So, from the readout that we got, it does say that President Biden described the implications and consequences if China supplies material support to Russia. It also said that President Xi says that a war in Ukraine is in no one's interest, he supports peace. That this is developed to, quote, \"such a point that China doesn't want to see it.\"Now, he is still more Russia's friend than our friend. But that's pretty clear. He doesn't like it. He doesn't want it. But he says it's on the U.S. and NATO to broker this deal.GUTFELD: Wow.TARLOV: So, but that makes sense.WATTERS: He said that?TARLOV: Yes.GUTFELD: I should have read it.WATTERS: He put that on us?TARLOV: It is --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: How dare he.TARLOV: He put it on us. Because --WATTERS: Let me see this. He said that?TARLOV: Are you kidding me?WATTERS: How dare he.TARLOV: He said that because fundamentally for Putin, this is about Ukraine wanting to be part of our system, and not part of Putin's system. So, that seems like a pretty good call. I know you would have done better, but it seems good to me.WATTERS: Could have done --GUTFELD: Judge, can we play alternate -- alternate history? If Trump was president. First of all, Putin won't invade.(CROSSTALK)PIRRO: First of all, let me say this, if Trump were president, we wouldn't have had that meeting.GUTFELD: Yes.PIRRO: Where everybody just repeated their own talking points. This was nothing more than a face-to-face photo op. That's all it was. Biden got nothing out of it. He didn't get Xi to say, gee, you're right, Joe, I'm with you, I'm with you on all of this. All they said, all China said was, look, you know, we just, we don't like confrontation. We don't believe in war.But do they condemn Ukraine -- do they condemn Russia for attacking Ukraine? Absolutely not. And then, then they say China tells us. They make it very clear. They say China wants the U.S. to promise -- and this is in the readout too, that there will be no conflict if they take Taiwan, which is their strategic objective.And that's a problem for us. Because 85 percent of our chips are made in Taiwan and we rely on them. So, you know, the Chinese are blaming us for Russia invading Ukraine because -- and now it's -- Jessica is right. That it's the United States and NATO that have to go to Putin and tell him to stop.And by the way, consequences, according to Joe Biden, to China is if they provide material support to Russia. What is material? Is it economic? Is it financial? And by the way, Joe, if you want to disconnect the United States from China, why don't you stop American companies that are going over there and manufacturing all kinds of American goods in China? Why don't you make it a negative for them to do that? Why are our medicines being made in China? Why don't you come up with something if you back America so we that can manufacture in the United States?MCDOWELL: We haven't gotten answers as to why the Wuhan flu --(CROSSTALK)PIRRO: All right. So that's it.MCDOWELL: -- was released by -- was unleased on the world and we still don't have answers about the origins.GUTFELD: All right. Up next, Dr. Doom and gloom is back. Fauci with a new warning on COVID lockdowns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)TARLOV: Dr. Anthony Fauci is back and warning America could face more COVID lockdowns as the new Omicron sub-variant spreads. Fauci admitting the variant is less serious than Omicron but could bring back mandates.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)Dr. ANTHONY FAUCI, CHIEF MEDICAL ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT: We need to be flexible. And if in fact, we do see a turnaround and a resurgence, we have to be able to pivot and go back to any degree of mitigation that is commensurate with what the situation is. So, we can't just say we're done. Now we're going to move on.(END VIDEO CLIP)TARLOV: So, Dagan, I want to come to you first about this. We aren't done. We still have 30,000 new cases a day and close to 970,000 Americans have died. Is he that off base by saying that?MCDOWELL: Count on the odious hack master to say something outrageous and you and talk about this for attention, because it's so cold being so irrelevant now. He's a power-hungry pipsqueak. But I'm actually happy that he's still around because when it -- if you know, if COVID comes back, if there's a rising cases, we don't trust this clown. And so, we will ignore what he says.It's better having this bozo still in a position of power rather than having somebody new who we might actually have to work through learning not to trust. By the way send Fauci over to figure out the origins of COVID that have killed a million Americans almost and six million people worldwide. Maybe he can get on the case for us since he helped funnel money to the lab in Wuhan.PIRRO: Exactly. Exactly.TARLOV: So, I know how Dagon feels about this.PIRRO: I'm exactly -- I'm exactly with Dagen. I'll tell you why. He ought to be able to solve it. He's the one who sent the money over there to make sure that they had that money. But here's the thing. This guy is all about being relevant. This guy also is about drama and politics and money and not in equal in science. And that's what Fauci is all about.He's got to be on every TV show. It must have been killing him for the last three weeks -- four weeks he hasn't been on television. And I don't understand, even the World Health Organization says it's not necessary to mask kids under five, and now they still want to mask kids under five. And kids dying are less than -- what is that, 0.001 percent under five, and we can't rule out anything. Keep scaring the American public. Keep controlling them.Look, it's less serious than Omicron, OK. And if it's less serious than Omicron, what are we worried about? It's cold at this point.TARLOV: I had it two weeks ago. It felt like more than a cold but --PIRRO: Well, you're here.TARLOV: I am alive. I am -- yes. That's on national television. Jesse?WATTERS: You know when you break up with someone and they won't stop calling and calling and calling. That's Fauci. We are done, dude. We are done. And he's like, no, you need me. You need me.PIRRO: It's over.WATTERS: I do not need you. We are good. He is annoying. I'm with you. He seems kind of disappointed that the pandemic is over. Remember how jocular he used to get and giddy during these interviews during the pandemic, making jokes and being the center of attention. And after Putin invaded, he seems sad. He actually seemed sad.Three weeks ago, they asked him, when you're going to take off these masks mandates, what's going to happen, Fauc? And he goes, oh, it's risky. It's going to be risky. I don't think we should do it. After he said that, cases dropped about 70 percent. The guy is so wrong.And he goes on Tapper show. And Tapper is supposed to be a big-time journalist and he says yes, you know what, if things turn south, we might have to go back to lockdowns. Lockdowns? That's been discredited. How didn't Tapper not say, Fauc, that was dumb. You were wrong. How do you not have Fauci on at this stage of the pandemic and just shred him limb from limb?MCDOWELL: Not literally.WATTERS: Not literally, on everything he's been wrong about. The guy's batting average is like close to zero?TARLOV: Greg?GUTFELD: Well, I don't know what to say now because -- you know, I think --TARLOV: Maybe that you're happy I'm alive.GUTFELD: Yes.PIRRO: Yes, we are.GUTFELD: All these lies. I think he's a great man.WATTERS: Yes.GUTFELD: Yes, yes, yes. No, he's -- he was prom king for two years and now he's just a chaperone and he's got to live with that. But I want to touch on what the Judge said about the masking the kids because there's a lot of new research out that shows that, you know, among the very liberal contingent, they're embracing permanent masking, which is now -- what we're seeing is we're flipping the typical script of left and right where the left generally were the risk takers, right, and it was the right that was, \"more conservative.\" That's how -- that's in all studies.Right now, the infatuation with government intrusion has overridden their love for risk. It's really kind of fascinating to see people that like to think that they're edgy and cool wearing two masks and a faceguard while they're alone in their car with their, you know, visualized world peace on the bumper sticker, right? It's like, what happened to you people?So, now it's part of a kind of a global identity, liberal identity that you got to be pro-choice, you got to be a climate extremist, you got to be an anti-gun rights, pro identity politics. Now masking is part of it. If that's not part of it, it's so interesting. We have a new part of this constellation, and it's not ever going to go away.WATTERS: Greg, you have to be anti-gun here, but we can send every single weapon to the Ukraine.GUTFELD: Yes, that's true.WATTERS: Right? Light them up.GUTFELD: Exactly. Yes, hawks.TARLOV: We got to go. I just want to be on record and saying that I respect Dr. Fauci.PIRRO: You were on time.TARLOV: And I am on time.PIRRO: You respect Fauci? Is that what you said?WATTERS: Oh, there you go.TARLOV: It is what I said out loud, and I'd say it again. I respect Fauci. Straight ahead, a blue city mayor blaming right-wing media for growing concerns about crime.PIRRO: I respect science.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Liberal cities are getting rocked by violent crime. But one mayor is saying fears are being completely overblown and the right-wing media, they're to blame.GUTFELD: Yes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LONDON BREED, MAYOR, SAN FRANCISCO: You know, there's a lot of noise about what's happening in our city. You see it in the headlines often in the right-wing media. They love to talk about San Francisco, don't they? You see it on social media. You see one video take off as if it's telling the whole truth about who we are.(END VIDEO CLIP)PIRRO: Oh, you're not.WATTERS: Would you like to begin, Judge?PIRRO: I really didn't intend to say that. I thought -- well, you know what? She's not. I'm telling you right now, she's not, OK. She's the one who said how many months ago, it's time to reign the criminals who are destroying our city. It's time for that to come to an end. And it comes to an end when we take the steps to be more aggressive with law enforcement.Is she schizo? You know, at one point, it was like Black Lives Matter, we got to make sure, you know, they have social justice, then it's like the reign of criminals has to end, then it's the right-wing media's fault. No, it's not. Read the statistics. That's all I have to say.And you know what? I was in San Francisco not that long ago and I was -- I was afraid. And in the tenderloin district, people are dying all the time because they're doing cocaine. Not the cocaine kills them, but because of the fentanyl that they're putting in the cocaine that's coming from China in an undeclared war that has come to the border of with the Mexican cartel. That's all I have to say.WATTERS: I'm glad we went to you first, Judge. But you're right about that comment she made. I forgot about that. That was a great point. What would you like to say in response to the judge passionate commentary?TARLOV: I'm mostly in agreement. And I think that, yes, it happens. And I would say also, that a lot of liberal leadership is in agreement. We talk about we're all here in New York City. We have a mayor that got elected running on a tougher on crime agenda with a criminal justice reform component to it, which I think is basically where everybody wants to be, certainly in the post-George Floyd murder era.And I think that what Gascon is saying in L.A. and what London Breed is saying in that particular statement is a bit of an outlier. And the Biden administration has been clear, you know, from the beginning, we're not talking about defunding the police, we don't think that this rhetoric is helpful. And if you look at the people in leadership with Clyburn, Biden, obviously, Kamala Harris, they're all saying this is not how we see things. So --WATTERS: Why did London Breed talk about the right-wing media?MCDOWELL: Because she's grasping for straws. Is it gasping? Gasping is for air and grasping for straws?WATTERS: Sure, both.MCDOWELL: Both Biden and Kamala Harris ran on getting rid of cash bail. So, that's the central problem here in New York City. So, let's not dismiss. Oh, and by the way, they couldn't stand up and say, riots are bad, stop burning our cities until the poll numbers turned against them. It went on for months until they stood up and denounced the violence it was happening in major cities across the country.I want to point out real quick. George Gascon was actually the police chief in San Francisco before he toddled on down to L.A. appointed by --WATTERS: He was?MCDOWELL: Appointed by Gavin Newsom. And then he was appointed by Gavin Newsom, then the mayor, to be the District Attorney of San Francisco. So, this dangerous liberalism, the pro-criminal anti-victim stance is like general herpes. It spreads and you can't see it and you can catch it. It winds up in your city and there's really no treatment for it. There's no -- there's no --TARLOV: Gascon was elected, by the way.WATTERS: Someone --MCDOWELL: Not in -- not in San Francisco, he wasn't.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: Someone besides Greg referenced this.MCDOWELL: Do we have Valtrex for this kind of liberalism?WATTERS: Go ahead, Greg.GUTFELD: Gascon, I thought he was very helpful when he was offering tips to avoid being a victim of crime. He said, lock your doors.PIRRO: Brilliant.WATTERS: Oh. I'm going to write that down.GUTFELD: Yes. Here's another tip, avoid getting shot. Don't stand in front of an incoming bullet. I thought that was helpful. I find that -- I've said it before, but it bears repeating. Progressives deny the brutality and suffering of crime because they don't see it as a human problem. They see it as a political issue that they must indulge to placate their base. So, they talked about criminal justice reform rather than let's help the victims, right?Their base sees victims as a reckoning for 400 years of oppression. Although the last time I checked, elderly Asian women didn't own slaves or support Jim Crow, so I don't know why they're so silent about other minorities being destroyed in the streets. I don't want to get gross, but I will.There's a dude that just attacked a woman in the subway by smothering her with his human feces on her face. He boasted that he was going to get out. He got out before she got her treatment. He was out laughing about it. How was that not like assault with a deadly weapon with the bacteria?WATTERS: Is that it right there?GUTFELD: It's a chemical attack. It's an act -- I mean, it's like -- but this is the state of society right now. A man can walk up to your mother, your grandmother, take a bag of crap shove it in her face. Her eyes were burning. It was in her nose. And he laughed and he walked out how can you stand for this S-H?WATTERS: You know what Fauci said about this?GUTFELD: What?WATTERS: The woman should have been wearing a mask.GUTFELD: Mask, there you go. She should have double mask or she wore the plastic.WATTERS: Or the face shield. All right coming up, the White House scrambling after the liberal media finally admits Hunter Biden's laptop is real.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hunter Biden, this laptop, Russian disinformation.WOLF BLITZER, ANCHOR, CNN: Ongoing Russian disinformation efforts.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ongoing Russian disinformation effort.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ongoing Russian disinformation campaign.BRIAN STELTER, ANCHOR, CNN: If the New York Post tells you your mom loves you, you should check it out. We are not talking about fully reliable sources here.(END VIDEO CLIP)PIRRO: Go to him first.MCDOWELL: Tater.WATTERS: Dagen?MCDOWELL: Boy, they surely look stupid. More than a year after the election, the liberal New York Times finally admitting Hunter Biden's laptop is real and not Russian disinformation. Greg?GUTFELD: Well, they don't -- they don't look stupid because it worked. I mean, Trump lost, Biden won. You know, they look -- they don't look stupid, they look corrupt because they are corrupt. There has to be accountability. The 50 or so former Intel officers who claimed it was Russian disinformation which was then fed to all of these bozos that we just watched.They need to be hauled into a committee and they need to be -- they need to be interrogated beyond belief, because they knowingly helped change an election by helping to shut down a legitimate news story in which the media colluded with them. So, from now on, this is positively Putin-esque. Never take a lecture, never trust anyone in the media again.This is -- this is a great testament to tell you what they can pull out. They swayed in election. We -- you know what, we might not even have the -- we might not even have had this war.WATTERS: Greg, they didn't sway it, they rigged it. I think that you can say it was rigged. Look at the definition of rigged in the dictionary. It's exactly what they did. We're not talking about machines and voting, we're talking about covering up a huge story. Big tech conspired with the Democrat party with the CIA to snuff out a major scandal that would have changed the results of the election.They did the survey and they said like, you know, 10 percent of Biden voters, if they had known about the laptop situation, wouldn't have voted for Joe Biden in an election which was based on what, 49,000 votes over a couple swing states. That's the deal, man. So, you can now say it's rigged. You can say it.And here's how stupid the media is, Dagen. The media takes the word of the CIA and politicians. Think about how dumb you are to believe the CIA and the politician is telling you the truth.GUTFELD: It's great watching Stelter questioning the New York Post and given the state of CNN.WATTERS: Right.GUTFELD: What a mess.MCDOWELL: Right. And the New York Post story was censored by Twitter where individuals could not even share it. That's how corrupt the big media is and big tech.TARLOV: I do remember that. I also am relieved that I never said Russian disinformation. I just said I really don't think that this matters because people are not voting for Hunter Biden. And you can throw your pen, Judge. She threw her pen, by the way.PIRRO: No, I dropped it.TARLOV: I really find it very hard to believe. And I saw that survey as well that people who were Biden voters, and I believe they were motivated by the fact that they thought that Trump was fundamentally corrupt, and too unhinged, do the job --GUTFELD: And look who turned out to be corrupt.TARLOV: But show evidence that Joe Biden turned out to be the --GUTFELD: It's in the laptop, the big guy. He's the big guy.TARLOV: Where is the evidence that there was any money transferred that Joe Biden personally pocketed on it?WATTERS: They commingle the accounts. They had joint bank accounts, they had a credit card. One of Hunter's boys did Joe's taxes.TARLOV: Are you really -- OK, are we going to play the children who commingle finances gains because --GUTFELD: Oh, here we go. Putting up with Trump.WATTERS: It's not dirty money.(CROSSTALK)TARLOV: It's not dirty money?WATTERS: It's not dirty money. He's under investigation for money laundering and tax fraud.PIRRO: It's my turn now.GUTFELD: This should have been the A block.PIRRO: First of all, he wasn't a child commingling money, OK. He was an adult who got $1.1 billion from China, who got $83,000 a month from Ukraine, got $3 million for the widow of a Russian mayor, OK. So, now, we've got a kid who's sharing his money with his father who's complaining about the fact that he has to pay for everything for the family. Tony Bobulinski comes out and testifies against his own self-interest that Joe was in a meeting.This isn't just talk. This is circumstantial evidence for which you can prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. There's one thing I want to say. I want every one of those people from Mike Morell, to Leon Panetta -- Leon Panetta, to Clapper, to Brennan, to all of them to testify under oath as to why they said it was what it was.And you know what I knew Leon Panetta was a liar when he started saying we couldn't get to Benghazi in 2012 within 13 hours from the -- from the tip of Italy to the top of Northern Africa. Mike Morell says they were just extremists. They weren't Muslim extremist. What were they, Irish extremist?These are political operatives. So, what you have now is not just Democrats who care about power, they care about power and the money it brings in the Biden family is part of that trough -- pigs at the trough. And that's all I have to say.GUTFELD: And that's all you have to say.PIRRO: And I dint throw my pen, I dropped it.MCDOWELL: \"ONE MORE THING\" next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PIRRO: It's not time for ONE MORE THING. Jessica?TARLOV: So, I had a baby, which is very exciting. And I had this great baby shower here thrown -- oh, it's not showing up.GUTFELD: That's OK.TARLOV: OK. Anyway, yes. So, you guys throw me a great baby shower, the whole crew. Greg gave me this amazing picture of himself. He said it had to go in the crib. I want him to know that I did. Put it in the crib.WATTERS: In the crib.GUTFELD: Yes, there you go.TARLOV: Yes. So, that's baby Cleo with Greg. She's amazing. We've had the best time with her so far. I can't believe she's already three months old. That's her, very tiny.PIRRO: She looks beautiful.TARLOV: Thank you. That was her one month birthday. That's a little Cleo cake.PIRRO: You were feeding her cake? Oh, my God.TARLOV: She didn't. She's smiling now and all the drooling and that's what my mom --WATTERS: Look at the hair.TARLOV: Yes. She's got Brian's hair.WATTERS: Major hair.PIRRO: Wow.TARLOV: That's her three months picture.WATTERS: A lot of hair.TARLOV: Yes.PIRRO: She's big.TARLOV: You say that every time.WATTERS: What are you feeding her? What are your feeding her?TARLOV: I'm feeding her formula. Anyway, she's fantastic and I love her a lot.PIRRO: She's beautiful. Congrats.WATTERS: Wow. Look at that hair.GUTFELD: All right, all right, I got to plug the show.PIRRO: All right, Greg, go.GUTFELD: That's a beautiful baby. OK, tomorrow night, I'm going to be in Phoenix, Arizona at the Arizona Federal Theater. There are still tickets available ggutfeld.com. And tonight a great \"GUTFELD!\" We got Kennedy, Rob Long, Carley Shimkus, Kat Timpf. See, I'm quick.PIRRO: And that's it for us.WATTERS: You are quick.PIRRO: We'll see you back here on Monday. \"SPECIAL REPORT\" is up next.Content and Programming Copyright 2022 Fox News Network, LLC.

      "  This is a rush transcript of \"The Five\" on March 15, 2022. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello everyone. I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro along with Geraldo Rivera, Jesse Watters, Sandra Smith, and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5:00 in New York City and this is THE FIVE.President Biden is headed to Europe and NATO headquarters next week as Russia launches more barbaric attacks. A missile strike hitting an apartment building in Kyiv sparking a massive fire and destroying it completely. Official saying at least three people were killed. And President Zelenskyy who is set to address Congress tomorrow is signaling a possible breakthrough about wanting to join NATO. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE: Ukraine is not a NATO member. We understand that. We are quite adequate regarding our understanding. We have heard for many years about the open doors but we also heard that we can't enter those doors and this is truth and we have simply to accept it as it is.(END VIDEO CLIP)PIRRO: Mike Tobin is in Lviv, Ukraine with the latest. Mike?MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, judge, just about every night is a rough night in the city of Kharkiv. It is to the far east of the country, very near the Russian border and it was one of the first cities hit. Last night was no different. The capital city, Kyiv, took more pounding. An apartment building was hit and this as the Russian army attempts to bring forces from the north and the east to surround the capital city of Kyiv.It is now under a 35-hour curfew as imposed by Mayor Vitaly Klitschko who said Kyiv is now the forward operating base for freedom. The siege on Mariupol is constant. The Red Cross is now accusing Russia of blocking the aid convoys that we're attempting to bring food and water to the people who have been without water, power, and heat now for at least 10 days. Some good news out of Mariupol after multiple ceasefire attempts for humanitarian purposes have fallen apart, a humanitarian convoy or civilian convoy, some 160 vehicles long, made its way to Zaporizhzhia and to safety. Judge?PIRRO: Thanks, Mike. All right. Well, it seems like the slaughter is continuing and it's getting worse by the day, Geraldo, I'll start with you. When do you think enough will be enough for Putin?GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS HOST: I don't think enough will be enough for Putin and less and until Ukraine is absolutely crushed, crumbled, destroyed. He will not stop. I think that people who are optimistically forecasting that they're running out of ammo or the offensive is petering out are -- they don't know Putin. They don't remember Hitler and Napoleon, how they underestimated the Russian army also.War is hell, judge, we talk about that all the time. Putin is the devil. He's a war criminal. His invasion of his neighboring sovereign nation is as barbaric as it is unjustified. And now his brutality has struck the Fox News family. A team led by our correspondent Benjamin Hall was attacked grievously wounding the correspondent, the person you see there in the foreground, Pierre Zakrzewski, his cameraman killed. Sasha Kuvshynova, their local producer and translator and guide also killed. So we lost two.Benjamin, as I mentioned, grievously injured. We pray for him. We send our condolences, our deep condolences. There you see Sasha in the background that little person, just 24 years-old, dead now as is the cameraman in this photo, Pierre Zakrzewski, dead. It's just awful. We pray for Benjamin. We send him our condolences for the loss of his colleagues, our colleagues. It's something that is deeply heartfelt.I want you to know that we are a family and we mourn this loss. War is not the romantic panorama you see in the movies. It's ugly. It's dirty. And these fine people now struck down in the prime of their lives just a child, 24 years-old. And Benjamin Hall, you know, in the fight for his life. It is, judge, something that is so appalling. I'm so angry and at the same time I feel so helpless to do anything about it.PIRRO: Well, so many people are feeling helpless. And Greg, I mean, at some point, I mean, America has to start drawing a red line.GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, you know, I want to talk about Ben, but first, the fact that Joe is announcing that he's going to Europe next week. No. This is what we're talking about. This is -- what we need is audacious diplomacy right now. Is there some kind of like a special episode of Matlock that he's watching that he's too busy? Does he want to stick around here for St. Patrick's Day?No, he should be on a plane right now meeting with the very top players, with other top players of the country, not this casual diplomacy and back padding is just disgusting. As for Ben, I spoke to him last week at length after we had our little kerfuffle. And the thing that pisses me off most about him is that he's handsome and he's funny and we joked about what went on THE FIVE.And we -- I'm not going to say we talked about it because frankly it's nobody's business, but he did say something that I agreed with a hundred percent and he said, \"Greg, you can't do my job and I can't do yours.\" And I said duh. My job is way easier. I'm not in any danger.\" I don't -- I do get death threats but they're usually from Dana on pink stationary.But we can afford to pontificate because we're here thousands of miles away. They can't afford to pontificate at all because they're always in danger and that's kind of been my lodestar. Geraldo said war is the worst thing that you can imagine. That's what we do here. We imagine. But what Ben and his co-workers do, they don't imagine it. They actually see it, which is why when I'm sitting here, for me, I must be as anti-war as possible until I can no longer be anti-war.Because it's like those TV hosts that were telling you to stay home indefinitely during COVID because they still worked. They still got their damn paychecks. They got the camera crew coming to their house. They were divorced from their consequences. That is the same thing here. It is easy to talk about war at home as Geraldo says. It's not romantic. But since I'm not going anywhere near the war, I'm sure as hell not going to tell a single person to go there and die in a foreign country.I learned that lesson with Iraq and I'm never gonna go through that again. Ben's job is to go there and delineate the truth through imagery. It is harder to do now than ever given social media, the internet, the rise of constant disinformation, but if you're sitting here at this table you must be a radical skeptic because you aren't there, Ben is. And I hope to God he makes it through. It's a horrible thing that happened to him and he's a -- to sound British, he's a lovely guy.PIRRO: Well, we're certainly all praying for him, but you know, Jesse, when the Biden administration talks about unequivocal support, but then they say we will not facilitate the transfer of fighter jets, what do you think Biden is going to say when he gets to Brussels assuming he gets there next week?JESSE WATERS, FOX NEWS HOST: He could get there during a hostage crisis. That city could be completely surrounded and he has no leverage. So I would suggest you do something dramatic before then. And we had General Kellogg on the show last night and he said we have to send them the Patriot Missile Defense System.So these batteries, they are surface to air. You could even send them the Russian-made ones, the S300's, and you basically can take out a cruise missile. You can take out a ballistic missile. You could take out fixed- wing aircraft like that. They're very expensive, about $100 million per system. But Ukraine is running low on surface-to-air defensive missile systems and that would be -- make a huge difference because if you could get him into Kyiv now before it's encircled that would stop the shelling.And so if you have the city surrounded by these armaments that are shelling, not only could you block it with the missile defense system you could take out the Russian tank columns with the Stingers and the Javelins. And that would really be the decisive action to make Putin --basically he's blocked. If you can't take the capital and you just get your artillery destroyed and you can't even go in and kill the president, the Ukrainians win in that scenario.So that's what they need to do and they need to do it immediately. And debating over MIG's forget about it. Send them the missile system. That's a defensive system.PIRRO: Right.WATTERS: So they can't spin that as offensive.RIVERA: They put it on the border already of Poland.WATTERS: Yes, but they should insert it into Ukraine. That would be a game changer.PIRRO: That's the question. How do you get it there? And you know, Sandra, I mean, you know, I watch your show every day. I mean, you're on top of this and I love watching you, but you know, the human corridors that we hear about where they're supposed to be an escape for people from Ukraine.I understand that they are still in trouble. That they are closed essentially and that is the more Putin is bombing, the more Putin is shelling, the more people are getting killed. We're talking about apartment buildings now, civilian buses. I mean, he's really after the Ukrainian people. It's no more, you know, just military buildings. So, what can the Ukrainian people hope for in terms of what our limitations are?SANDRA SMITH, FOX NEWS HOST: They're running out of time. There's no doubt about it. And to go to Geraldo's point about the relentless Vladimir Putin and the audacious diplomacy that is needed, the next big event is going to be President Zelenskyy addressing the U.S. Congress tomorrow morning.Whether that changes anything, I don't know. Certainly, President Biden when he visits Brussels next week, possibly Poland. No major announcement made so far. Possibly we could hear something different from this president. Former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker just made an incredibly important point about this moment saying that Vladimir Putin, Geraldo, to your point, is desperate and dangerous at this hour.He knows he is losing, he said. He's doubling down on his aggressions even as his strategic position weakens. He said this is why this is the most dangerous phase of this invasion right now and why the U.S. must manage this moment extremely carefully. He said, \"instead of saying what we won't do, in this moment, we need to say what we will do.\" And that's a big part of this moment.PIRRO: And that's one of the problems with this administration, not saying what they will do and telling the world what they won't do. Anyway, coming up, Biden's price hike propaganda. The White House deploying TikTok stars to blame soaring gas costs on Putin.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: President Biden getting more desperate after failing to gaslight the American people into thinking that Putin is behind higher gas prices. Now, he's resorting to teenage TikTok stars to push his price hike propaganda.(BEGIN VIDEO)ELLIE ZEILER, TIKTOK STAR: I had the opportunity to ask the White House why gas down the street is $7 and here's what they said. Russia is one of the top three producers of oil and it is actually their number one revenue source. Now with Putin starting this horrific fight between Ukraine and Russia nobody wants to work with him and do an international trade.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: And transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg isn't even focused on the surging gas prices.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION: Gas prices are famously something that is largely outside of the direct control of any political figure.(END VIDEO CLIP)RIVERA: Why do you laugh?WATTERS: Oh, just Pete. The spin is so hard. Greg?GUTFELD: Yes.WATTERS: Are you now convinced everything is okay after watching that TikTok propaganda?GUTFELD: I was sitting around going like could there be a move that's any more unserious than sending kamala to Poland? What could it be? What could it be? Why not use an app favored by 12-year-olds that's created by China that has infiltrated and mangled so many adolescent brains? IIt's funny. You know that -- I was thinking about this. TikTok might be the most effective cyber warfare in history because it's in every house. It causes kids to do really bad stuff to each other and to others. Sometimes it's self-mutilation. It's basically delivering crap to our kid's brains. Meanwhile in China, they use TikTok to educate their kids. They have rules. They go, I mean, it's like -- and yet we're polluting ourselves. But it's just, again, it shows you how unserious we are about ending this war.It's amazing. Boris Johnson, the guy whose hair looks like somebody dumped a bowl of linguine on it. He's on top of the energies question. He's meeting with these -- he's meeting with the oil people, the gas people because he's not concerned with pleasing 20-somethings. You go by they and them.WATTERS: We're meeting with teenagers --GUTFELD: Yes.WATTERS: -- on social media, Sandra. I don't know. Does it say that I guess Biden doesn't have any real fixes? He's just worried about P.R.?SMITH: If he does, he hasn't broadcast them or said what they are. Jen Psaki was asked about it again today in the White House press briefing and her answer is always that this is a priority for him to address these price spikes. For the average American consumer, it is painful. They acknowledge that, and say that all options are on the table. We still don't know what those options are.I speak to the oil and gas industry. I ask them what could be done to increase and incentivize more drilling, obviously, more oil production to bring those gas prices down. If you were to think about something really reasonable to hear from this administration, the oil and gas industry, the American Petroleum Institute says just send a friendlier message that you're not out to demonize the oil companies.And now you've got these two Democrats, Sheldon Whitehouse and Ro Khanna, they want to tax the oil companies more in a moment where we actually need them. We need more oil production to bring the -- and by the way, the message to the TikTok viewer out there is green energy, in a moment where 65 percent of the American people are living paycheck to paycheck. They're telling you on TikTok to go buy an EV. Do you know the average price of an electric vehicle is today?WATTERS: What's that?SMITH: Brain room (ph) says $60,000.PIRRO: Right.WATTERS: And Tesla just raised their prices because of all the supply chain problems. Geraldo?RIVERA: Aye, aye.WATTERS: Are you -- are you now on board with the Putin price hike after watching that young lady sell you on the talking points?RIVERA: Yes. That definitely put me over the top. I concede that President Biden blew it when he crushed domestic oil production. I think that that was strategic error regardless of the TikTokian (ph) presentation there. Biden should admit that he made a terrible error. But this, Sandra Smith, is also true. Exxon, Chevron, BP and Shell are all enjoying the highest profits they have in seven and a half years.SMITH: So what's your point?RIVERA: My point is that the oil companies are reaping record profits, some of this could be handed to the consumers rather than all of these --SMAITH: You want the oil companies to cut tax to Americans?RIVERA: -- Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell, I mean, why don't we look to them and say what's going on?WATTERS: Unless the government cut the gas tax then.RIVERA: But the gas tax is the only thing that keeps the highways together. If we get rid of the gas tax --WATTERS: We just spent trillions on infrastructure.SMITH: Yes.PIRRO: Didn't we just have --RIVERA: But you can't -- you can't get rid --WATTERS: Oh, Geraldo. You already spent the money on that.RIVERA: Many politicians of various stripes have pondered cutting off the excise, the gas tax and all comes to the same conclusion. It's reckless and irresponsible.SMITH: So are we --RIVERA: Look to the oil companies.SMITH: So, let me just ask you a question. Are you suggesting that those companies are engaging in illegal activity by falsely propping up gas prices because if you are, they should be held accountable? But if they are, then evidence should be provided because that's a big claim.RIVERA: I am suggesting that the oil companies are reaping windfall profits and Ro Khanna's suggestion of a windfall profits tax is much more viable to me than getting rid of the taxes.WATTERS: But you own stock --GUTFELD: The answer is always the tax.RIVERA: I do.WATTERS: Yes, he does. Okay. So you're getting rich, Geraldo.PIRRO: I have a couple of thoughts. The only people who are making windfall profits are Russia and Venezuela is about to make some, but let me just comment on the TikTok first. I never thought anything could be more ridiculous than when Kamala Harris had those young child actors helper in that space video. Remember, where you could see with your own eyes the moon. Remember that one?WATTERS: Yes.RIVERA: You look related you two.PIRRO: But I also want -- but I also want to talk about a segment of our population that we haven't talked about, and that's the senior citizens. So if the alternative to the Biden administration is we're not going to drill here, we're not going to loosen up the regulations, we'll go to -- we'll go to Venezuela, we'll beg the Saudis although they won't take our call, and we want electric cars.Senior citizens drive cars with internal combustion engines. They cannot afford an electric car. And unless the government wants to give them a voucher for an electric car with their next social security check, they're not -- they're the ones who are lost in all of this.WATTERS: You're right.PIRRO: They are on a fixed income. They cannot afford anything. They can't even think about an electric vehicle. So while we're going la di da di da di da, why don't we consider our parents, our grandparents, the people who fought the wars, who built the streets. They're being crushed while this president only cares about TikTok.SMITH: Can I just get this one last point in there because the White House and the Democrats like to tout the 9,000 leases that are not getting tapped into. They're not drilling. They've got the permits issued, but then create a friendlier environment for those energy companies to drill. Because if they drill, guess what they have to do? Spend those profits.WATTERS: Make sense, Geraldo?RIVERA: I'm all for it.WATTERS: Make sense.RIVERA: I'm all for it. I don't see why just because you are in favor of a green future, you can't do practical -- I'm a pragmatic idealist. Talk to Chevron, Exxon, BP and Shell and say listen, you guys are doing great.PIRRO: Is this capitalism?RIVERA: Now, do me a favor. Now go out there and drill.PIRRO: Is this a capitalist society. Leave them alone. Unless they're profiteering, leave them alone.RIVERA: They are profiteering.WATTERS: All right.PIRRO: Oh, all right. Then go to the Department of Justice and tell them that. Prove it.RIVERA: It doesn't (inaudible) necessarily illegal.PIRRO: Oh, okay.GUTFELD: No, it's profiting.WATTERS: We're going to do some profiteering right now and go to commercial break. So ahead, the White House says there's no red line when it comes to Putin's atrocities.RIVERA: It's true.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: New fears, Vladimir Putin is ramping up his brutality because time is running out for his military. According to reports, Russian forces are getting low on equipment and manpower and may only be able to fight full strength for 10 to 14 more days. Despite evidence of war crimes, the White House saying there is no redline.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We don't like red lines around here so I'm not going to use that phrasing. But you are obviously correct that what he has -- he has been very clear and consistent about his -- that he does not have the intention of sending U.S. troops to Ukraine. That has not changed.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: And Republican Senator Tom Cotton calling on Biden to actually stand up to Putin.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AK): What we should stop doing is worry about what Vladimir Putin thinks will be escalatory. Quit letting him set the terms of how we will support Ukraine. We should get off the back foot, get on the front foot and make Vladimir Putin worry about what will be escalatory.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: So, Sandra, they don't like redlines. What do you make of that? I mean, that's basically, you know, we are not going to take a stand or maybe they're just keeping their cards close to their vest.SMITH: You know, again, I think tomorrow will be a big moment. Zelenskyy is going to --GUTFELD: Yes.SMITH: -- he's going to make his statement very heard for U.S. members of Congress tomorrow. Here is what I think as far as the progression of all of this. I think you go back to Ambassador Volker's words that this is a defining moment in all of this and we have to start saying what we are going to do rather than what we will not do.And I listen to Jen Psaki every day, judge. You see if you're watching, we have a lot of times, we have her briefings. And they are very quick to say what they will not do and not broadcast what we won't.As far as Lindsey Graham earlier today saying why he believes that the U.S. is not getting involved and President Biden folding like a cheap suit, I think, was his exact words. I'm getting involved with the transfer of those MIG jets. He says he believes Putin got in his ear and threatened escalation if you do.And therefore we are letting Putin determine the next moves of the United States in this fight. And that has to come to an end.GUTFELD: Jesse, what should we do? Senator -- what's the senator? I can't remember. Tom?SMITH: Sen. Tom Cotton.GUTFELD: Yes, thank you, Sandra. It says that we should be setting the terms. What would those terms be?WATTERS: I remember when Trump just threatened to nuke everybody.GUTFELD: That's the term. That's the term.WATTERS: I didn't want to bring that up. But I did -- I did look into that today. So, he threatened to nuke North Korea. Remember, my button is bigger than yours and my button works.GUTFELD: Right.WATTERS: He threatened to nuke the Iranians. He said, we are the consequences of the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before. And then he told Putin that if he invaded Ukraine on his watch, he'd nuke Moscow. And then he said all options were on the table in Venezuela. You know, I like that line, all options are on the table.GUTFELD: Yes.WATTERS: And then he threatened Mexico. He was going to designate the cartels as terror groups. That means you can go drone inside Mexico proper. Now, remember those four years, it was -- it seemed chaotic, but it was relatively stable on the world stage.Biden's approach is so conventional. It's like he's a NATO hawk, but a typical liberal dove. It's like your typical, you know, Washington business lunch. You eat, you know, your steak and your salad and your unsweetened iced tea. It's obvious. That might not work, though.So, what we're asking is Joe, order off the menu. Maybe a naval blockade, maybe the missile defense system that I suggested. Maybe you pay a visit to his girlfriend in the Swiss Alps chalet, knock on the door with a stripper graham. I'm just saying, get inside the guy's head, do something that he's not expecting, because you have about a week and a half -- two and a half weeks before Kyiv is surrounded, and then you have no leverage after that.GUTFELD: You know, Geraldo, we were talking in the green room that we keep -- we keep hearing competing narratives. The Russians are on the run. That's according to U.K. defense sources. But then you look at the map, and the map doesn't look -- the map doesn't look good.RIVERA: I think that is not about Biden. This is about Putin. Putin has utter disregard for human life. He doesn't care -- he'll send those troops charging. An American commander will see an outpost, an enemy strong point and flank it and do all -- Russians will keep slamming it, slamming it, slamming it till finally, there's a last Russian left bell.This is an existential crisis right now. And that for us to believe that Putin will submit to the mother of all negotiations that Greg keeps promoting, I think is extremely naA_ve, with all due respect. You're not going to --GUTFELD: And what's your solution? You keep saying you don't have a solution.RIVERA: No, my solution is you have to beat him. You have to beat him. If this is a limited bore now, it makes no sense to me not to deliver the May 29. It if this is a limited war, it makes no sense to not take those patriots and get them into Ukraine.WATTERS: Yes.RIVERA: Get them into you -- because the only -- the only red line right now is the blood of the Ukrainian people fighting the Russians. They are the -- they are defending the free world. That's the -- that's the front line of humanity, civilization right now. That's what it is. It is the Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians and we have to give them whatever we can without putting Americans in the cockpit or behind the buttons of the Patriot missile system.I think that you can do it. You can -- stop advertising everything. Fight them. The thing about the Russians -- very quickly -- the thing about the Russian arm, they're saying now that as evidence of the Russian army falling apart, they're looting, killing, and terrorizing the -- that's a weapon.WATTERS: They always do that.RIVERA: That's a weapon. They -- they're looting -- they don't have supplies, but they'll loot anyway. They'll terrorize anyway. Ask the German women who they feared at the end of World War II.GUTFELD: Judge, last word.PIRRO: I disagree with Geraldo. Geraldo said it's not about Biden, it's about Putin. So, the question that I asked you, Geraldo, is why didn't Putin do this when Trump was President? And I don't bring up President Trump that much, OK. But I tell you right now, that he didn't do it when Trump was president, because he knew that Donald Trump would come in if you touch one hair on one innocent civilian, he wouldn't care NATO or non NATO.And don't tell me that Putin isn't afraid of someone. Biden is responsible for the decline of the West. What we are seeing right now is --I can't say the word. It's a wuss. We've got a bully in the in -- the in the yard, in the playground yard, in the schoolyard and everybody's back at the fence.RIVERA: How do you know --PIRRO: All we -- wait a minute. Let me finish. All we have to do is we have enough oil in Canada, the United States, and Mexico, and we could be our own superpowers. But right now the Biden administration is not only hurting the Americans and all this hashtag blame Putin TikTok nonsense. All this is crap.All he has to do is turn to America and let us be the strength. He is destroying the West.RIVERA: And how do you know -- how do you know that Putin wasn't playing Trump? How do you know? When you --PIRRO: Oh, stop. He wasn't playing Trump.RIVERA: When you see that he was --PIRRO: He didn't invade when Trump was president.RIVERA: I love Trump. I love Trump too.PIRRO: It's not about loving Trump. It's about the fact that Trump had everybody against the wall. And don't think it was anything different.RIVERA: How do you know that Putin didn't think Trump would give him Ukraine anyway?PIRRO: I don't give a damn what Putin thinks. I only care what Putin did. And he was a wuss when Trump was president. And that's the end of it.GUTFELD: There you go. That might be my favorite conversation of this whole year. We're monitoring the latest from Ukraine but in the meantime, a suspected serial killer nabbed after a murder spree in two liberal cities.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)RIVERA: We've been talking here a lot about the war overseas, but we are also as you know, fighting a war right here at home for the streets of our cities. And here are the latest examples of the wicked battle being waged.A suspected serial killer has been arrested in connection with the heinous set of shootings that targeted vulnerable homeless people in New York City and Washington D.C. That killing spree leaving two dead, injuring three others.And another man has been charged with a hate crime -- look at this animal - - for the horrific beating of an Asian woman. The racist punk stomping, punching the 67-year-old woman in the head more than 125 times. She suffered multiple contusions, lacerations, bleeding on the brain, and other Asian women victimized in stable condition after that assault. It's a it's a miracle. First comment on that.PIRRO: I hate it. I hate it. You know what? This is what -- this is what we voted for in New York. I know we're talking about New York now. You have a cultural institution, the Museum of Modern Art, you are a young woman working behind the desk and some guy -- a normal-looking guy comes in. He's upset, you know, that his permit was revoked or whatever. He jumps the desk to stab you and your girlfriend.See, the people that are committing --RIVERA: 24-year-old.PIRRO: The people that are committing -- coworker. People who are committing these crimes are committing them over and over and over again. And don't think all you social justice warriors, don't think that you're saving one guy because he committed or made one mistake. They commit mistake after mistake.They continue on their crime spree until they're stopped. And I know this, I know this. I know it in my -- in my DNA from having done this for 30 years. And I'm not surprised that this guy, one of the attackers, had 22 prior convictions. It's our fault that they're running around and victimizing us. I don't want to -- I don't want to take all the time, but unless you change the bail law in New York State, and unless we get rid of these progressive DAs, then we've got no hope.You just better hope that if you get shot or stabbed, that you don't die, because justice isn't coming, the cavalry isn't coming. And you're never going to get any kind of retribution.RIVERA: In Ohio yesterday, Mike DeWine, the governor, passed the law that allows concealed carry even without a license or any training. Is that a solution?GUTFELD: I guess when -- if the cavalry isn't coming, that's a solution. And you can't disarm a public if you also have no consistent law enforcement. You know, there's another part of this that we talked about before it drives me crazy. You know, this suspect is was homeless, probably mentally ill. All these people stabbing people, homeless, mentally ill. The serial killer claims by his dad to be mentally ill.At a certain point, you know, despite all the billions that we've spent on the mentally ill, it all goes into the pockets of the administrators. So, maybe we just stop -- like, what are we supposed to do? We're supposed to help the mentally ill but we leave them on the streets and we let them -- you know, maybe we just treat them like criminals. Arrest them and put them away.But that seems even worse, but we've got no choice. So, we keep pointing out these liberal laws and nothing changes. This is just like talking about the war. We talked about how horrible things are, but then we go like, what do we do? We've been doing this for three years. We got nothing. It's getting worse.RIVERA: Erica was in town, Sandra, over the weekend and went shopping on Madison Avenue, noting some of the stores still closed from the riots. But mostly noticing how prevalent homeless people are on the premier shopping boulevard of the premier city in the country.Does anything suggest dysfunction more eloquently than that visible problem were all of these people, whatever their background, are all over the place?SMITH: I hope she watched her back every time she turned a corner or walked down a block because it's scary in New York City right now and that is fact. The crime is running rampant. It's not just here but the one attack in Seattle stood out to me and broke my heart. She's a longtime healthcare worker. She was on her way at the rail station. She was going up the stairs when a career criminal in an unprovoked attack, grabbed her, 62-years-old, threw that nurse down the stairs.RIVERA: Is that the (INAUDIBLE)?SMITH: Yes. He Alexander Jay, 40 years old, cement steps, she suffered a broken clavicle, three broken ribs. She was rushed to the hospital, the very hospital where she has worked for 25 years helping other people. That gives me chills. That is awful. And that is just one example of the many unprovoked attacks that are happening in these cities all over the country.RIVERA: Mentally ill or not, a crime is a crime. That's why I think the Judge's point about bail reform is the one that resonates because when you commit a crime, you should be charged to the fullest extent of the law, held if you are a threat to society pretrial, and then given the full sentence if you're convicted.WATTERS: We can't do anything if the liberals won't help us do anything, Geraldo.GUTFELD: Right.WATTERS: You can't live in a society if half the society doesn't want to live in a civilization. We can crow about this old day. We've been showing this for two and a half years, this crime wave, and everybody knows what needs to be done, but no one does it. So, we're just sitting here complaining because liberal politicians don't care. They just don't care. That's the bottom line.RIVERA: Look at this -- look at this guy. Look at him. Look at this. Look at this.WATTERS: Yes.RIVERA: Can you believe --WATTERS: And they're going to go to work tomorrow in Albany and not do a damn thing about it.GUTFELD: And Geraldo, you don't see that -- you will not see that on other networks. This stuff doesn't exist.PIRRO: Oh, yes. Jen Psaki said, I'm about no consequences to crime.WATTERS: Geraldo, you know what they did today in Congress? They memorialized Daylight Savings Time.GUTFELD: Yes.WATTERS: That's what they did.PIRRO: That was big.WATTERS: They made Daylight Saving permanent. And they have this all over the street.RIVERA: I was worried about that one.WATTERS: And that's what they're busy about.RIVERA: Next, convicted hate crime hoaxer Jussie Smollett already scheming to get out of prison.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SMITH: Jussie Smollett will not go quietly. The actor of sentenced to 150 days behind bars for staging a hate crime is demanding to be set free after spending only five days in jail. Smollett's lawyers claim being locked up is a danger to his health.Judge, should he be let out of his 100 day sentence in jail because it may risk his ability to survive?PIRRO: Let me tell you something. This guy is lucky that he was sentenced in a state where he only has to serve half of the time that the judge gave him. He got 150 days. He only has to serve 75 of those days. But let me make one thing clear. A jury of your peers convicted you, a judge has sentenced you, and you are legitimately in a jail. And stop this act or nonsense, where you're the victim and you should be freed because you're -- you may be in trouble.So, what they did was they put you in protective custody. So, in case you think as an actor, you're more important than you really are, that you're protected. But here's the bottom line is lawyers then come out and they say we can't have him in protective custody because it's a danger to his mental health.Why don't you just shut up, get your three meals a day, and you're caught, and serve this sentence? You created a tremendous problem for this country, dividing us and putting salt in an old wound having to do with racism. Shut up, sit down, and serve your sentence.SMITH: All right, so Jussie Smollett's family announced that they received a call where the caller used racist and homophobic slurs.PIRRO: Oh, wow.SMITH: The caller also said that they hoped someone would take care of him in jail. Do you think that his lawyers are going to effectively make the case that he shouldn't ride out his sentence?RIVERA: Who said that? He said that on the phone?SMITH: His family.WATTERS: Come on. Gutfeld has worst death threats every Monday morning. Come on.GUTFELD: Yes. Like I said, they're from Dana.PIRRO: Yes, we all do.WATTERS: You know, he is behaving exactly how we expected Jussie Smollett to behave. He's being a drama queen. He's bitching. He's moaning. He's making it all about him, so he gets his attention.So, here's what I suggest you do. He's an actor. Use this to bone up on your craft, Jussie. You know, you have a great opportunity. You could come out of this and write a screenplay. You could star as the -- as the head of the prison gang.RIVERA: He could produce it in prison. He could produce it in prison.WATTERS: Yes, I mean, this is what you should be doing with your time.RIVERA: (INAUDIBLE)SMITH: Greg, I wish you could respond to this.GUTFELD: I wish I could.SMITH: So he's saying a lot, including his brother, who says he, Jussie, wants to let folks know that he's very stable. He's very strong. He's in very good health and ready to take on the challenge that has been put up against him.GUTFELD: You know, he also said that he wasn't suicidal. That was a very important thing. He said, I'm not suicidal, I'm not suicidal. Meaning if they find him, you know, in an attempted suicide or suicide --RIVERA: They had a noose around his neck.GUTFELD: -- it won't be -- yes, exactly. Because he knows that everybody -- it's so -- it's such an ironic mind-bender because he was the person who put the noose around his neck. And now, he say, I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to -- it's like the boy who cried wolf except you did it last time. So, we have to make it -- we're putting you in a psych ward because you put this noose around your neck before you might put it around again.But I'm worried that in prison, there's going to be two red hat-wearing MAGA supporters who will inevitably target him. But then I realized, everyone in jail is a Democrat.PIRRO: Oh, I didn't get that.SMITH: Geraldo?GUTFELD: It's true.RIVERA: Well, first of all, he's obviously referencing Jeffrey Epstein and worrying that he could have the similar fate. But I am absolutely 100 percent against solitary confinement. They call it protective custody. It's really solitary confinement. They pretend that it's for your protection. It is really punishment.WATTERS: Geraldo.RIVERA: Let me finish.WATTERS: Geraldo.RIVERA: You are -- you're in these -- in solitary confinement, you have no one to talk to. There's no TV. You get out one hour a day. You count the tiles on the roof. You go absolutely nuts.WATTERS: You want him in general pop?RIVERA: It is vicious. He should be in some farm someplace.WATTERS: A farm?RIVERA: Yes, like a prison -- you know, like the kids go to.GUTFELD: You have no solution.WATTERS: Geraldo, farm?GUTFELD: You know what, they're worried about Hillary Clinton. He knows the Clintons.PIRRO: The reason -- the reason he's in protective custody is because he said his life is being threatened.GUTFELD: There you go.PIRRO: I mean, you can't have it both ways. You can't say you're stable, and then say your mental health has bothered because you're in protective custody.RIVERA: People really know. Ask them what it's like.PIRRO: You know what?WATTERS: He needs to go to a farm.(CROSSTALK)PIRRO: He needs to shut up and sit down.GUTFELD: Maybe a petting zoo, Geraldo. What about petting zoo?RIVERA: Petting zoo would be fun.GUTFELD: Yes, yes.SMITH: All right, We'll leave it there. We're going to have more breaking news from Ukraine next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PIRRO: Welcome back. Fighting continues to rage in Ukraine as the country's president, Zelenskyy is set to address Congress tomorrow. Let's get to our quick final thoughts. Real quick, Greg. What do you think?GUTFELD: I'm going to quote my favorite philosopher Tim Dillon who said that Putin is a monster but demanding a no-fly zone and jets before you try to make a deal as people die seems to be crazy. So, as a guy in an air conditioned studio, I'm not going to beat a war drum. That's it.PIRRO: Sandra?SMITH: President Zelenskyy said today that 97 children have died in his country since the beginning of this and that's awful. That is awful.PIRRO: Jesse?WATTERS: So, Zelenskyy is going to make an extremely emotional appeal to Congress tomorrow, and Congress will be very affected by that appeal and they will move Biden to do something differently than he's done so far. Because as we've seen, Biden leads from behind, and that's the only way you're going to get any action out of that guy unless he's pushed.RIVERA: Our thoughts and prayers with our colleague, Benjamin Hall, our brave correspondent. And with Sasha and Pierre, rest in peace. Our love to you and your families. We are so sorry about what happened.PIRRO: Yes, very, very sad. And I think -- I think that tomorrow in Congress, I think that's Zelenskyy will be very effective. He is a great communicator. He can cause people to be very emotional and I think it's going to -- he's going to do a great job.And you know enough with people laughing at him because he was a comedian. This man is a man who stands tall and stand tall I think for all history.That's it for us. \"SPECIAL REPORT\" is up next with Bret.Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2022 Fox News Network, LLC.

      "  This is a rush transcript of \"The Five\" on March 10, 2022. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello everyone. I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro along with Geraldo Rivera, Jesse Watters, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5:00 in New York City and this is THE FIVE.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We will do everything together in partnership, in solidarity to support what is necessary at this very moment in terms of the humanitarian and security needs of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.(END VIDEO CLIP)PIRRO: Vice President Kamala Harris out in Poland doing her best to clean up the big mess over fighter jets for Ukraine. The Biden administration claiming a breakdown in communication as the reason for them blocking the deal that would have gotten Ukrainians the air defense capabilities desperately needed to fight off the Russian invasion. Harris claiming the U.S. is united with Poland despite the disconnect, even dodging a question about it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNKNOWN: What kind of alternative plans does the United States have to get materials to help Ukraine defend itself especially now that you have declined Poland's offer on jets.HARRIS: I want to be very clear. The United States and Poland are united and what we have done and are prepared to do to help Ukraine and the people of Ukraine. Full stop.(END VIDEO CLIP)PIRRO: And the vice president's visit to Europe is apparently all for show. According to \"Politico,\" White House officials say Harris is not there to make any deals but merely as a symbol of the administration's commitment to Ukraine. What Harris did, however, was bring awkward moments like this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNKNOWN: And for President Duda, I wanted to know if you think and if you asked the United States to specifically accept more refugees?HARRIS: Okay.(LAUGHTER)HARRIS: A friend in need is a friend indeed.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)PIRRO: Jesse, I'll go to you. Why did they even send her?JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, Hunter was busy.PIRRO: Hunter?WATTERS: Yes.GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS HOST: So snotty.WATTERS: Sorry, Geraldo. I don't know whether she didn't know that she was being called upon or couldn't answer the question because she was just asked will you guys accept refugees.PIRRO: Right.WATTERS: She always accepts refugees. She's never said no to accepting refugees and she couldn't handle it and she tossed it to the Polish president. That was strange to then cackle and laugh during a time of crisis like this. Putin's got to be looking at this and saying to himself and his KGB, this does not look like a united front. When you have a kerfuffle amateur hour with the Polish jet, it's a fiasco.Biden apparently said yes, send jets, and then the Pentagon said now, we can't do it. So Biden said it was the Polish president's idea. And so she goes over there and it's a word salad. I counted some phrases and we're paid to speak for a living, so we know when someone has no idea what they are talking about.GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: You're the expert.WATTERS: I am. In three sentences, this is what she said, to the extent, in terms of, in light of, in particular, and as it relates to. There is a guy on social media, I think Matt Walsh was his name. He said Kamala sounds like she's trying to hit the word count for a term paper. Remember in high school you just had to get it to 300 words. That's how she sounds.So, I'm sick of them saying nothing and I would actually like Biden especially to stop saying what he won't do. I know people have said that before, but why not keep Putin guessing? Why not maybe say, you know, what we might actually -- we're not taking anything off the table? You know, maybe you buzz some jets over the Russian border, maybe you throw some subs into the Black Sea.Maybe you pay Putin's girlfriend to visit in Switzerland. You knock on the door, the Chalet, maybe deliver a bouquet of roses, maybe the CIA writes a little something in the note. I'll see you in the Hague. Get in his head. Because right now Putin doesn't -- and what's he have, two weeks to surround the capital. Zelenskyy is in deep trouble if he can't hold this guys off soon. And it's, you know, they're going to starve him out and then they're going to send in assassins. We don't have a lot of time. We have to do something more than we're doing right now.PIRRO: Well, you know, Dana, given the fact that she doesn't even have the ability to say, yes, we will accept refugees when she's in charge of the border is really -- it's stunning. I mean, she has the, like the intellectual horsepower of a fourth grader. I mean, why is she there? Didn't she know that she'd be asked these questions?DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I wouldn't -- I think that she was sent there on a mission that was destined to fail and this has happened again and again to her.PIRRO: Intentionally?PERINO: No, not necessarily. I think because that the administration is just like cross purposes. Once, she was like -- she was going to go to Poland because she was going to deliver something tangible. And then when she gets there, after the fact, they say actually no, she's just there to show a symbolic relationship.Now, her performance was very much not tear down this wall, okay. It was better than John Kerry taking James Taylor to France. But she gets there, so she doesn't have a deliverable to say, the MIG's are going to get to Ukraine. But not only does she not have a deliverable, she didn't know the answer to the question about why the MIG's aren't going.PIRRO: Right.PERINO: And that's the most important thing that she could have done today, is provide clarity on that. Now, instead, we're on the third day of everyone saying help us understand. Javelins are okay to send. The Patriot missiles system. All of that is okay, but the MIG's are not. That might be a good decision, but can you explain it to us? And they are not able to do that.She should not have taken the assignment if she wasn't going to be able to deliver something, or she should have said, I have got an idea, why don't we deliver this, X, Y or Z or she could have said the refugees are welcome, they just got to get through Mexico first.PIRRO: All right. Go ahead, Greg.GUTFELD: What? I was just writing something down thinking I probably can't say that.PIRRO: You know what, look, she could get -- she could become very sensitive. I'll ask you this, Geraldo. She could be --(CROSSTALL)PIRRO: Are you ready?RIVERA: -- children are at play -- what?PIRRO: Are you ready?GUTFELD: Go ahead, go to Geraldo. Go ahead.PIRRO: Are you ready?GUTFELD: No, go ahead.PIRRO: Okay.GUTFELD: I won't interrupt.PIRRO: She can get very excited about ICE and she can liken them to the KKK. And she can be very knowledgeable about certain things.RIVERA: I think that's her fail point.PIRRO: And then all of a sudden she's clueless on the national and the international stage.RIVERA: Oh, I think you hit on something legitimate with that criticism because she seemed meek and unsure, to Dana's point. She didn't go there with any kind of decisiveness. Whether or not she had a deliverable, she could have been optimistic.For example, we saw stunning video today of apparently unless someone contradicts or say it was staged, of the Ukrainian Special Forces ambushing a Russian tank column with their javelin missile and tank after tank or with the drones, tank after tank blowing up Russian tank (inaudible).She should have been this, we're getting them, the fight is on and Zelenskyy is doing a great job, and this is the Alamo, and we should celebrate their courage and their patriotism. A little zest, a little optimism instead of going there and nervous laughter that's off cue. You know, it just -- it seems, you know, I want to love her. I want her to be the historic figure that she is.PIRRO: She's not.RIVERA: But she's not living up to who --GUTFELD: Gerald, you can't change people.RIVERA: You can. You can, but you can still aspire and my headline -- look at my cane. I'm sorry.PIRRO: Okay.WATTERS: Those are (inaudible) this time.RIVERA: And my -- falling apart. My headline is that the Ukrainians ain't beat yet and we're helping them fight and Putin is thinking, man, maybe this wasn't such a good idea.PIRRO: Is that what Putin is thinking, Greg?GUTFELD: I think that Putin realizes that we're not in it to win it, right? We wouldn't have sent her. She's great for us, this show, but she's lousy for this job. She makes us laugh but her laugh is so unsettling because it wasn't -- she wasn't laughing at an obvious thing that other people could see. It was an inside joke of sorts.So, this is kind of like what are they doing up there right now? I don't understand it. She's like a child. She's on a big trip. She's like a child who is allowed to see the cockpit, but you better not touch anything. Please don't touch any of the buttons.She's not allowed to have any impact on anything because she's not to be, you know, they don't trust her. She is right now a Polish joke. And I love that she said full stop.PIRRO: Yes.GUTFELD: But you think when you -- not that's the unserious stuff. The serious stuff and the sad part is this is symbolic virtue signal that is replacing real activity. We do not need this sort of emblem, is what she was referred to, she's an emblem of our concern. We need a shocking, audacious, diplomatic effort and we need it swiftly.I've talked about it before. You know, we spent a lot of time and billions of dollars in Ukraine. Now they need this? We've got to send our very best there, not the joker in a pantsuit. We need Obama. We need Trump. We need Bush. They got to go. One or -- two, the combination because we need mediation on steroids that expresses how much the world is disgusted by this and how intent we are on stopping the bloodshed and potential World War III. Without that, by doing this, this only prolongs it.PIRRO: Yes.GUTFELD: This prolongs the suffering and it makes us look like we don't care.PERINO: Can I add one other thing? Is that she had a message to send to the American people, right, because we are all watching. Putin's watching, but we haven't talked about the Ukrainian response and their reaction to her speech was abysmal. And to Geraldo, you said she should have spoken with optimism for them. If you like hanging on every single word the administration says and those were the words today --GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: You would not feel like you were comforted.RIVERA: You definitely needed defiance.PIRRO: Yes and she has, I think, failed in all of those. In any event, with the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine getting worse, many of you are asking how you can help. You can join Fox in supporting the Red Cross relief efforts there. Donate now by going to redcross.org/fox/. Over $2 million has been raised.And coming up, horrific images of mass graves in Ukraine as Russia claims that their hands are completely clean.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)RIVERA: How low can they go? Is there truly no bottom for the ruthless Russian regime, now blaming Ukraine -- is trying to blame Ukraine for that disgusting attack on the maternity hospital in Mariupol.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SERGEI LAVROV, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translation): We didn't attack Ukraine. About Ukraine, as we have been explaining many times, a situation threatening directly the Russian federation security was created there.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Looks bad.RIVERA: Are you going to blame me or you lying eyes? We're getting even more nightmarish images from Mariupol where the attack took place. We must warn you that these images are very graphic. Ukrainians forced to bury innocent civilians in mass graves. The unrelenting Russian bombardment leaving city officials with no choice. The morgues are overflowing and sadly it is just not safe to hold individual burials.Trey Yingst is in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, where he and the Fox team I must say working tirelessly under the near constant threat of attack. So filled with admiration for the job you guys are doing. Trey, what is the latest?TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS FOREIOGN CORRESPONDENT: Thank you very much. The Ukrainian capital of Kyiv continues to brace for a Russian advance on the city. Over the past 24 hours we have seen explosions in the distance, air raid sirens going off, and Ukraine's air defense system in action.The war is getting closer and closer to this capital city of nearly three million people. Though the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said today about half of the city is actually evacuated since this invasion began. Staying in the city though is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy who spoke directly to Russian soldiers who invaded his country.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VOLODYMY ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translation): You can still save yourselves if you just go home. Do not believe your commanders who say that you still have a chance in Ukraine. Nothing but prison and death awaits you here. You are taking our lives and we'll pay with yours.(END VIDEO CLIP)YINGST: We do have a sad update about that Russian strike yesterday against a maternity hospital in the southern city of Mariupol. Officials say three people were killed including one child, at least 17 others were wounded in that attack. The Ukrainian president has called the attack a war crime and you can see from this video there is evidence of a civilian area, a hospital being targeted with a Russian strike.The deputy mayor of Mariupol detailed other disturbing actions by the Russians in the city since the invasion began, saying more than 1,200 people have been killed, dozens today buried in those mass graves. They simply don't have time to bury the dead.These lifeless bodies just thrown into the ground. A gut wrenching reminder of the brutality being inflicted on the civilian population here. But again, the capital of Kyiv, they are seeing these images across their country and fearing that the days to come could have even worse things in store for the population here. Back to you.RIVERA: Trey, do you get a sense, you know, of almost a physical ominous sense that the vice is closing?YINGST: You do. I mean, you look off on the horizon at night and see the explosions in the distance. Air raid sirens are going off every few hours and people here really are bracing. Every time we leave the hotel, you go through checkpoints and every checkpoint has a soldier there, they have got the yellow arm band to signify they are Ukrainian.And they are working to look through these cars to make sure there's no Russian advance forces trying to get into the city. We have seen the battles already take place here as the Russians send in troops to try to figure out how much resistance they are going to face.But they are in desperate need right now of ammunition of anti-aircraft batteries and anti-tank missiles. They realize the fight to defend this capital is going to be a long fight, it's going to be a bloody fight, and they will have to dig their heels in and protect the city.RIVERA: Trey Yingst in Kyiv, the capital. You know, judge, I'm sure we have a plan, Fox News and the other media outlets for the safety of these men and women, these brave men and women, our reporters there. But imagine being in the middle of that and seeing artillery explosions all around you. At a certain point you get the message that you're trapped.PIRRO: Well, you know, it is a testament to their courage and their valor and their determination to bring us the news and bring us the truth. Obviously, Kyiv is in a position where it's being encircled by the Russians. It's just a question of time, it appears, before they take the city.But the problem is this -- you've got hundreds of thousands of people now who don't have food, water, heat, energy, people are now fighting each other for food. And we've got a scenario here where, you know, instead of going there with the vice president laughing about refugees, I mean, we should be swearing and promising that we're going to give you food, we're going to take care of you, we're going to help you.But I say to myself, when is enough, enough? How bad does this have to get before we actually do something? I mean, this isn't new to Putin. Putin has done this in Chechnya. He's done it in Syria. He's got us back down like a bunch of wusses, you know, saying okay you can do the anti-tank missiles, but don't you dare send any jets and then we back down even though Blinken at first said yes, we're going to do it. I mean, you know, how many people is a dictator allowed to do this to before we say enough is enough?RIVERA: Good point. Calling us fake news, the Russians are, Lavrov saying that we staged this, that all this that you're seeing, all this video, you know, belies the fact that the Ukrainians did it to themselves and their own children.WATTERS: I'm getting some CNN vibes out of that guy. These are real pigs. That animal, Lavrov, I hate that guy, god. Yesterday, Putin became officially in the eyes of the world a war criminal. The world was rattled yesterday. Yesterday was a very, very significant day, the attack on that hospital.And the Chinese have to be thinking to themselves, I can't be in the same room with this man. And every country has to decide can they align themselves with this monster because if you get a few more attacks like that on hospitals, on women and children, women are giving birth in basements, you're going to have a no-fly zone. Putin is --RIVERA: At least.WATTERS: -- very, very close to inviting, you know, international coalition and to stop this from happening. There's black markets for vegetables in Mariupol. They are boiling snow for water. There's no more medicine left. They looted the pharmacy. People can't eat. They can't drink.It is disgusting. They are burying bodies without ceremony. Just pushing them into ditches, freshly-dug ditches. This can't last for that much longer. I swear you're going to see a huge revolt among the international community pretty soon.RIVERA: To that point, I think that Jesse really eloquently expressed it. Napoleon said the morale, Dana, is to physical is three to one. The spirit is everything. Zelenskyy has done a good job of keeping the spirit up so far. That's why I was disappointed in the vice president's trip because I don't think she contributed anything to the morale.PERINO: She did not meet the moment and that is unfortunate. I wanted to mention one thing about the fake news situation. So, in 2005, I was deputy press secretary and I had a chance to go on an overseas trip and one of my responsibilities was to brief President Bush 43 and Putin right before the press conference.And I was told make sure you tell Putin that he's going to get a question from the American press that he -- question about press freedoms in Russia. So, I go in there. I'm really intimidated, right? First of all, I barely know the president and then I'm here in front of Vladimir Putin.And so I deliver the message. I say, you're going to get asked about this. And he says, why would I answer that, and he looks at 43 and says when you fired that newsman. And the president says, what are you talking about, Vladimir? He say, you know, you fired the newsman. And 43 says are you talking about Dan Rather? He said that's not how it works. He works for a private company. That company fired him. I'm telling you as your friend don't go out there and say that.And I was thinking back on that today that I don't know if Putin really didn't understand or was choosing not to understand, but it didn't matter to him because he has relentless focus on his audience back home. And it's a constant shading of the truth to the point of lying about attacking civilians.RIVERA: How tall is he?PERINO: Not much taller than me.PIRRO: Really?RIVERA: So you really could look him in the eye.GUTFELD: About 5'10.PERINO: Well, there's a great story about Condi Rice actually going there to see him --RIVERA: Oh, she looked down on him?PERINO: Well, 43 sent her. She was sitting. He was mad about the message she delivered. So he stood up and looked over her so she said, I just stood up too, and then she was looking down over him. He didn't like that.RIVERA: Do you, Greg, know the Klitschko brothers, the fighters?GUTFELD: Yes, they are fighters. They're boxers, but I don't know them personally.RIVERA: I mean, but wouldn't that be a great image? Push them forward rather than the vice president.GUTFELD: Yes. You haven't seen -- you haven't seen them much. I think one of them was on (inaudible) earlier.RIVERAS: One of them is the mayor of Kyiv.GUTFELD: Yes, exactly. Exactly. I love -- the one thing we didn't touch on, which is actually sadly hilarious, is that Lavrov also said that Russia didn't invade Ukraine.WATTERS: Right.GUTFELD: That was amazing. So, okay --RIVERA: They just took a wrong turn.GUTFELD: They took a wrong turn. So, I don't know what exactly this is. But then they also said that the hospital bombing featured crisis actors, including a renowned Ukrainian blogger/influencer. That's coming from the Russian embassy in the U.K. So this is -- we're used to having a fog of war. But now we have a fake news fog of war thanks to social media because now everybody comes in and goes -- and they have -- they can create their own fake, what do you call it? Fakes -- deep fakes. They actually show the --RIVERA: Propaganda.GUTFELD: Yes, and it goes -- and it would be nice to have like war umpires that could just be down there and call these disputed claims for us. But we have pictures which kind of tell us, yes, this happened, but what is this into -- to what Jesse was saying, what is this information telling us to do and are we willing to do it?And we have to raise the alarm without being crapped on, because it's a matter of America going to war. So we could sit here and then leave at 6:00, but we can see then we go, this stuff is bad, it's got to stop, okay, we agree, are you ready to stop it? What are you going to do? Because this --RIVERA: I need your answer. You posed the question so well.GUTFELD: What? The answer being?RIVERA: What are we going to do?GUTFELD: What do we do? Well, I would say absolute like an out of the box, shake the box mediation. I think a truth, and promise this, a truth in reconciliation committee for this polarizing escalation, meaning that it's Russia and Ukraine have to come to the table because this is about -- this is about getting them.RIVERA: But doesn't it start with the fact that Russia invaded Ukraine?GUTFELD: Yes. Absolutely.RIVERA: Doesn't Russia have to get out of Ukraine?GUTFELD: Well, that's got to be part of it. I would say in the massive, like, in this kind of steroidal mediation, we have to agree to a stop and fly to where they are and meet them. Beat them where they arePERINO: And Zelenskyy even -- Zelenskyy made a decent offer.PIRRO: Yes, he did.RIVERA: Yes. I thought -- I agree with --PIRRO: Zelenskyy said that he doesn't want to be part of NATO anymore. And that was a real signal. But I understand that they are talking behind the scenes. Not the principals.GUTFELD: Yes.PIRRO: But they can work something out. It's about NATO and it's about the Donbas region.GUTFELD: Because if not, we're going to get a no-fly zone and then we're going to shoot down a Russian jet and all bets are off.WATTERS: Yes.GUTFELD: And then we're --RIVERA: At what point do we get the no-fly zone? Now, there are several thousand dead, 100 babies? At what poin? Thousand babies, 5,000 babies?PIRRO: Until we don't have the stomach for this. Its 24/7 every day. Then doing surgery without anesthesia.GUITFELD: The question that is raised and it was on another on another network, was why isn't America shooting down jets that bomb maternity hospitals? That's the question we're supposed to answer.RIVERA: Up next, the White House accused of pushing the gas price propaganda with its latest effort to spin the pain at the pump.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Welcome back. The White House working overtime to convince Americans that record-high gas prices are all Vladimir Putin his fault.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: You may have noticed this week that your gas prices have gone up. I want to talk to you a little bit about why. A lot of it has to do with Vladimir Putin. But part of this is on the oil companies right now there are 9000 approved unused permits that oil and gas companies could tap into now to ramp up production.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: What do you make of that, Greg?GUTFELD: That was interesting. Yes, there's a lot of price increases. There are hotels going up 30 percent, furniture 70 percent, chicken 13 percent, dry cleaning, baby food eight percent. I don't think any of that has to do with Putin's war. So, this inflation was going on well before they've been making up this crap.And we know they've got the permits. They -- nobody wants to go into the weeds on that. But we know that a lot of that stuff isn't usable and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. The problem with having a Democrat in charge in this kind of ordeal is if the consequences match their desires, they will not mitigate the consequences. We see that now.Isn't it weird that the White House dismisses higher oil prices? It's because they wanted higher oil prices well before this war started and Putin invaded the Ukraine. This is why they don't care about it because they want us to pay more. They want us to feel pain at the pump so we reduce our oil usage our gas usage and then we go to the -- you know, cars with windmills in their back seats.We are also reminded that Joe Biden is an inside weather vane. Whoever's in the room with him, he will simply do what they want. He's an empty vessel. And right now, a roomful of eco-freaks and far-left anti-West academics are making him do whatever they want.PERINO: If you could play this, Control Room, call for number one. This is -- right before the State of the Union, we talked about some Biden administration accomplishments are now vulnerabilities. Here's what he said on fossil fuels in the past.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I want you to look in my eyes. I guarantee you, I guarantee you, we're going to end fossil fuel.One of which is doing away with any subsidies for fossil fuels, number one. Number two, holding them liable for what they have done.We will double offshore win. We were end any subsidies for coal or any other fossil fuel.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: And now, they're like, oh, but there's all these leases. You could just go ahead and do whatever you want.WATTERS: Yes, we're going to end you but you better drill before we end you. This is crazy. If you're going to blame Putin, fine. Let's just say, blame Putin all you want. What are you going to do about it? They're still not doing anything about it. They're just finger-pointing.Ronald Reagan, one of the ways he brought down the Soviet Union, he told Gorbachev, he said, bud, we're going to pump our own oil. And he got the Saudis to pump oil, and that almost bankrupt the Soviet Union. And he sold the Saudis a ton of weapons and made the Saudis happy. What are we doing now? We cut arm sales to the Saudis and we're pissing them off because we're trying to redo the Iran deal. It's ass backwards.God, I sound like Greg, what is happening? All -- he negotiates with the Taliban, but he won't talk to big oil. Think about that. They asked him today, why won't you even have any of these oil executives over the White House for some tea, for some croissants? Talk about how you guys are going to make prices better for the people. And she goes up, well, we don't have anything on the schedule for that.Well, you should because you guys have to work together with these people. Oil is like food. You need it to live. You can't survive, America cannot survive without oil, inexpensive oil. So, they need to get their act together. And I'm sick of him telling people to drive electric. He doesn't drive electric. He drives these muscle cars. They get terrible miles to the gallon. Psaki doesn't drive an EV. Does Mayor Pete driving EV. None of them do.It's like the masks. Remember the masks? You guys all have to wear masks. But then you see him out and about with no masks, going partying, and eating at the French Laundry. That's the same concept.PERINO: And it's been going on for years. Remember Al Gore did that, Judge, right? It's like everybody should turn off all the lights in their house and it turns out his electricity bill is higher than everybody else's.Right. Right. You know, the whole thing -- the whole idea is they want to bring Iran back to the table. They want that Obama Iran Nuclear Deal. And instead of dealing with the Saudis who we shouldn't be dealing with, we're dealing now with Iran. And we're dealing with Iran, with Russia at the table. And I thought that we were sanctioning Russia, but now we need them at the table with Iran.To me, this is like if you need a babysitter, right, and you have a 15- year-old daughter who can babysit but you say, no, I don't want my daughter to babysit. I'm going to go next door. But next door is a convicted murder. And the guy is threaten to kill you too, but I'll see if he's got a babysitter.RIVERA: He's nice. He's nice.PIRRO: He's a nice guy. All right, whatever. But that's what they're doing. They're dealing and emboldening our enemies to put us in a lurch so that we can pay them to commit more heinous deeds. That's what we're doing.GUTFELD: Dana, that was the first analogy from the judge. It was pretty good.WATTERS: It was a good analogy.PERINO: Well done. Well done.GUTFELD: Her first analogy for the show.PERINO: We love the analogy of the babysitter.GUTFELD: You broke the seal. You broke the analogy seal.PERINO: Well done.PIRRO: I didn't know I was -- you were waiting for one. Oh, OK.PERINO: Geraldo.RIVERA: She's got -- she's got a ton of them. I don't care if you blame Putin, the oil companies, or Joe Biden. What I really don't like is the partisan divide. And I've never particularly heard oil fatcats who are reaping record profits being their virtue extolled quite as eloquently as it has been here.I think the notion that we want -- that the Democrats want intentionally high oil prices to make the country go green is preposterous.GUTFELD: They've said it.PERINO: They've said it.PIRRO: Yes, they did say it.GUTFELD: They've said it.RIVERA: Well, I -- it is preposterous.GUTFELD: Believe your ears.RIVERA: I believe that the oil companies are making record profits. Look to where -- the follow the money.PIRRO: Yes. Follow it all the way to Iran and Russia and maybe Venezuela. That's the problem.RIVERA: And Park Avenue, and Fifth Avenue, and Wall Street.PERINO: All right, ahead, a chilling warning that Russia could do the unthinkable and unleash chemical weapons on Ukraine.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: As Russia ramps up attacks on civilian targets, the Biden administration warning Putin could use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PSAKI: What we endeavored to do when we put out that information yesterday is to remind the world of the large biological and chemical weapons program that Russia has, the fact that they have used it in the past against dissidents on their soil and on NATO soil.NED PRICE, SPOKESMAN, STATE DEPARTMENT: We know the track record of the Kremlin. This is a government that has used banned chemical weapons on its own people.So, we know what this government will resort to, can resort to, has resorted to in the past.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Jesse, what do you make of this?WATTERS: They could use something on a city if things weren't going well. You know, they can't do urban combat very well. It's very hard to do that. And so, I could see them threatening that with Kyiv. So, I don't know what they're capable of, but they're capable of a lot.From what I heard, there are two bio labs in that country, one in Odesa, one in Kyiv, and the U.S. government has involvement with it because we say that they're there to protect against deadly pathogens, and, you know, swine flu, and avian flu and things like that. U.S. Senators had been involved in trying to create these centers and protect these centers after the Soviet Union collapsed. We're still there. We still have a footprint.So, I guess we're saying that if Putin takes Odesa takes Kyiv, then those Bio Labs would be vulnerable to Russian forces. And then God knows what you could do with any of these little samples. You saw what happened in Wuhan. You get a sample loose and you get a pandemic. So, I mean, there's a lot of concern there.GUTFELD: Dana, whenever there's a chemical weapon attack, it seems like in recent experience, both sides blame each other. It's like -- and they don't -- they don't take responsibility for their own atrocities. This is another case where we need a war ump.PERINO: Well, what's interesting is that, remember, Assad did this on his own people in Syria. And who was Assad's patron in that war? It was Putin. Yeah. And so he didn't care. And so, it wouldn't -- I wouldn't put it past them.And also, the U.K. said something similar? Well, almost exact same thing, so I'm assuming the United States in the U.K. has the same intelligence. And why would they share it, right? They've -- we've been -- this is a strategy that they've been using over the past several months to say, we know what Putin is about to do, we know what he's about to do.Now, that hasn't necessarily deterred things from happening, but perhaps this also sends a message to China. If China has the ear of Putin, and if they get wind that this is a possibility, and they know about having this junior partner in the new cold war that they are going to basically have to take care of for the rest of their lives, they might say, you better not.GUTFELD: Yes, that's a good point.PERINO: That might be useful.GUTFELD: Yes. Because the judge -- Judge, I mean, he's already a pariah. He's turning Russia into a pariah nation. Use chemical weapons, I don't think there's any turning back. In this kind of -- in this kind of war with the -- with the visuals, no way.PIRRO: You know what, Greg, it's all about the visuals. And that's the difference between Syria and Aleppo and Chechnya. It's about the visuals and we can see it.RIVERA: Agreed. And I think that he will be seen as a pariah. But again, he's gotten away with so much up to this point. You have to say you know, who's going to step up and tell him he can't, OK? And what I think is interesting about these bio labs, you know, we deny, we deny, we deny. It's preposterous, don't waste it, you know, any ink on it. And yet, isn't it interesting that we haven't heard or seen Fauci in weeks, you know? I mean, that's loved.WATTERS: Where is Fauci?PERINO: Yes. Why did he disappear? I'd love to ask him if he knows anything about that.RIVERA: Give Fauci a rest for goodness sake.PIRRO: No, I don't want to. Now it's time for him to face some questions.RIVERA: No, I think --GUTFELD: Fauci is mad because Zelenskyy is getting more ink. Let's be honest.RIVERA: People got bored with the -- with the regular war narratives, so now it became for the last 48 hours all about bio and chemical. He's not going to use it.PIRRO: How do you know it?WATTERS: OK, Geraldo, one of the officials from the --RIVERA: He's more likely to use a tactical nuclear weapon.WATTERS: -- Biden administration testify this that there's labs in the country. That's why it came out not because of boredom.RIVERA: So, how did it come out and now suddenly it's the headline everywhere?WATTERS: I don't know.RIVERA: Our whole show is devoted to it.PERINO: It was in the hearing on Capitol Hill about worldwide threat.RIVERA: Well, I think that the hearing should be about Mariupol which is the Guernica -- you know Guernica?PERINO: Well, you should run for office.RIVERA: The Picasso picture of the people watching the bombs fall, the Seminole picture, the image of the Spanish Civil War in 1937.PIRRO: This guy is an animal. What makes you think he's past doing something like that?RIVERA: I think that there are some steps you don't take.PIRRO: Well, you may, but he doesn't.RIVERA: Even Putin. Putin is already a pariah.GUTFELD: All right, ahead, another amazingly tone deaf comment from the Biden administration about Ukraine.PIRRO: Oh, this one.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: The Biden administration just can't help but use the Ukraine refugee crisis to push their liberal green agenda. Climate czar John Kerry making this outrageous comment.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN KERRY, CLIMATE CZAR, BIDEN ADMINISTRATION: If you think migration has been a problem in Europe in the Syrian war, even from what we see now, wait until you see 100 million people for whom the entire food production capacity has collapsed.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Greg.GUTFELD: I love this talking canoe paddle because he's a great reminder of like the problem of having a single ideological filter. So, he sees everything through the filter of climate. And he comes off as a buffoon because he applies it in non-climate issues. So, he just inserts it everywhere.And you see modern academics do that with -- except their filter is America as an oppressor. CNN for seven years, their filter was race. And what did that do? It created tribalism and no ratings. So, it's really bad -- it's the best advice for somebody who wants to be successful in life, it's to have a number of filters that you can use.I tend to see everything through the prism of media persuasion, which at times is amazing, but other times, you know, makes me an insensitive jerk.WATTERS: That's the prism you choose?RIVERA: You said it. We didn't.GUTFELD: But I admit it.WATTERS: All right, I thought there was another prism in there somewhere.GUTFELD: Well, there is one.WATTERS: There is one. It's disgusting. Dana, what are your thoughts on the human --RIVERA: Now, I'm really interested.PERINO: Well, I think Secretary Kerry -- well, he's also -- now he's the climate czar which is a little weird, right? Please, let's drop the czar term at the White House. He's very mission focused. And that's what he's been talking about.But think about -- he was the Secretary of State. He had all the issues. And he could be the person that they helped bring in to, like, make something happen, like something creative. And instead he's talking about this. Food prices are going to go up because no food can be grown or get out of the breadbasket of the world, in Ukraine and Russia.And there will be uprisings. And it won't necessarily just be because of climate change, it will because of the cost of food, like what happened in Egypt in 2008.WATTERS: Yes, it's going to get crazy in the Mideast with the wheat. Geraldo?RIVERA: But it is true, Jesse, that millions of people have been uprooted by this and millions more will be. You have entire populations on the move. This is the biggest refugee crisis dwarfing Afghanistan and Syria in Europe. Wait until all these people start going West into these other countries. At what point can Poland -- will Poland say enough, basta, I can't handle anymore.WATTERS: What was it? Basta?PIRRO: Basta.RIVERA: Basta.WATTERS: Got it.PIRRO: Basta. Yes, when are we going to start taking these refugees in?WATTERS: I can't wait. The Vice President Glee basically whiffed.RIVERA: Cleveland wants them.RIVERA: But you know what, it seems we're taking everybody else. I mean, we could either bring him in through the Mexican border or, you know, we should let --GUTFELD: These are real -- these are real honest to God refugees. They're escaping a war. They're not looking for a job.PIRRO: And these are people who --RIVERA: Cleveland would love them. We love them.RIVERA: And by the way, these are freedom fighters. These are people who believe in the same things that we believe in. I mean, their families are staying back to fight for freedom and for the country. They believe in Ukraine. They believe in their mission. We want them here.WATTERS: Do you think Biden is worried that the Ukrainian refugees might vote Republican?PIRRO: Yes. Kind of like the Cuban refugees. Remember when Mayorkas said not from Cuba.WATTERS: I don't know what he believes, but I'm shocked that he hasn't invited more of them here.GUTFELD: That's a good angle. Biden doesn't want Ukrainian refugees because they'll vote Republican. I just wrote your headline.WATTERS: That wasn't my idea, by the way.RIVERA: It sounded like it was.WATTERS: No, it wasn't.GUTFELD: I just spun it for (INAUDIBLE).(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: More breaking news. There's a lot of those from Ukraine next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PIRRO: Welcome back. Russian forces unleashing hell on civilian targets in Ukraine. And there's no signs of them letting up. Let's go to our -- let's go to the table for the final thoughts. I'm left out of noun. Jesse, 10 seconds, hit it.WATTERS: 10 seconds. I read in a piece in The Wall Street Journal tower.PERINO: Wow, very good.WATTERS: And it was an interesting idea. I won't endorse it but it was at least someone thinking outside the box. They thought about maybe setting up a no-fly zone in Lviv which is way west, there's no Russian forces anywhere near there, and you kind of dare the Russians to touch that and it shows presence and it shows initiative.PIRRO: OK. Geraldo.WATTERS: Did you hurry me up?PIRRO: I did.WATTERS: Of all people, Geraldo.RIVERA: All the talk of fake news and the other debates internally don't for a second think we don't absolutely support the patriot Ukrainian people fighting for their survival. We love them.PIRRO: We do.RIVERA: We give them all our props.PIRRO: Dana.PERINO: I think one of -- I'm going to piggyback on something that Jesse said. When I read Dan Henninger, the Wall Street Journal column, it said that, like, that's creative. Because basically it would do like with Berlin after the World War.WATTERS: Yes.PIRRO: Yes.PERINO: So, that was an idea. At least there's something to make on the press.PIRRO: So, what do you think, Greg, Berlin?GUTFELD: I don't know. I'm still -- I'm hoping that we do some majestic mediation with the Truth and Reconciliation Committee built into it. But I don't know how we can keep this from going truly catastrophic. I'm sorry to be depressing.PERINO: Yes. I don't know the truth has anything to do with politics. But that's it for us. \"SPECIAL REPORT\" up next.

      "  This is a rush transcript of \"The Five\" on March 9, 2022. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Judge Jeanine Pirro, Geraldo Rivera, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's five o'clock in New York City, and this is THE FIVE.Horrific new images coming out of Ukraine that we must warn you are very hard to watch. Carnage at a maternity hospital after it was hit by a Russian air strike with babies and mothers inside.Ukraine accusing Russia of intentionally targeting the building in the city of Mariupol. Officials say at least 70 people were injured in the blast. President Zelenskyy called the attack and atrocity and saying that children are buried in the rubble.Mike Tobin is in Lviv, Ukraine. He has the latest for us. Hi, Mike.MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And Dana, that is the development we've been watching in horror as civilian casualties pile up. The unthinkable has happened with this maternity ward being struck by Russian munitions resulting, as you mentioned, in 17 injuries, there are still rubble there. And also produced the images of a woman apparently in labor injured in this blast being hauled away from a hospital.Another image that you can see is a big crater outside of the hospital from the impact of the blast. Now Mariupol has been under siege really since the start of the invasion. There is not access to food, there is not access to water in that town. Several attempts at humanitarian ceasefires to let the civilian population get a break have fallen apart quite quickly, with Ukrainians saying that the Russians are targeting the civilian population, trying to flee this town.As it relates specifically to this maternity hospital, a Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov was asked. He said simply, we don't target civilians. If they are not targeting civilians and if this was a dummy munition and not a munition that you can aim, certainly there is a callous disregard for injuries to civilians as we have seen time and time again since this invasion began. Dana, guys?PERINO: All right, Mike, thank you so much. Geraldo, one of the things that happened in the war in Syria was Russia bombed ultimately from the air 54 hospitals, four in one day, it's not out of the question that this might have happened there, or happened there, excuse me.GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: I am tortured, Dana, by the fact that what happened in Aleppo and what happened in Chechnya didn't move me, didn't sicken me because I was not thinking of the victims of those bombs in human terms. I was thinking of them as the strategic enemy of peace. And I feel very guilty about that.But when I see this. Putting that aside to the extent that I, a, ever will be able to, seeing what Putin did here, Dana, with this indiscriminate -- it isn't indiscriminate, it is intentional bombing of a maternity and children's hospital. You don't hit a building like that unless you aim for it.And to see those images of the woman in labor and another one with a child hurt and another with the baby crying and the mother unable to comfort the child, it drove me to the point where I just say Putin is a son of a bitch and I don't want to provoke him into nuclear war, but there must be a way to get those MiG-29s to Ukraine a creative way.If we could in World War II on the precipice of war with Hitler, if we could contrive a way to get our aircraft, despite the Neutrality Act, over the border to Canada so that the British could use them against the Germans. If we could manage that scheme, there must be a way to do this. Even if you have to take the damn things apart and ship them up in cartons, there must be a way to get those jets.We can't let these people continue to be the victims of indiscriminate bombing where they are -- it doesn't matter how brave they are, it doesn't matter, all those foreign volunteers and the women with AK-47s and all the rest of it. They can't stand against a missile and a bomb. Their -- it's the skies are hell.PERINO: Jesse?JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I'm afraid MiG are not going to solve the problem at this point. You're going to have to do much more and I don't know if the west has an appetite for that. We are going to have to steel ourselves because this is just the beginning. They are going to lay siege to city after city, atrocity after atrocity, and it's going to be shot into our brains.And the leaders of these western countries are going to have to decide. I don't even think a no-fly zone is going to stop this. So, here is your choice, I don't think we are going in, but they are going to have to destroy the Russian economy. Meaning they are going to have to stop all oil and gas to Western Europe.Germany is going to have to say, sorry, we are going to have to maybe not turn the lights on for a little bit. They're going to have to just buy up all the LNG they possibly can. They are going to have to find some oil and gas and maybe some African former colony or something like that. They are going to have to do that because that's the only way you're going to stop Putin. You have to obliterate the economy, obliterate the energy sector and force a coup. I don't see any other way around it.He's not leaving Ukraine. He's not saying OK, I'll turn around the tanks. He's going to keep eating that country limb from limb until he owns it or until he's deposed. And the question is how are we going to do that?PERINO: We kind of see that in the map as, Bill Hemmer been at the board and he shows you that the advances are encircling all over the cities, at least the eastern half of the country.GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS CO-HOST: Yes. I mean, what Jesse says is right. It's going to get worse. It's going to get really bad, we knew that. Because it was -- in Putin's head it was supposed to be over quickly.WATTERS: Right.GUTFELD: Now it's just going to go on and on. The CIA director says Putin is in a mess and we know this. He mistakenly thought that Ukraine was weak and that Europe wouldn't amass a strong defense, which it has. He though his military was up to the challenge that his economy could weather this.So far, he is wrong which means he is going to get more desperate, which means he is going to have even less regard for civilian casualties and civilian or innocent loss of life. And it goes back to what both of you are saying and it's what we talked about yesterday.What do we do? We are presented with a choice and the obvious Ukrainian desire is the no-fly zone, but if you do that you shoot down a Russian jet, then we are at war with Russia. We might already be in a war with Russia. But if we don't do that then this goes on indefinitely. And then it raises the question, from two weeks ago, do we want this as badly as Putin does? Because if so, then we have to go all in.Because we are going to be looking at these come as you say about stealing, we are going to have to look at these photos, these horrible images every day, every day, because as long as we sit here on the sideline, the massacre will be prolonged. Right?But there is a solution and it's something I was going to ask you about before the show but I figured I wanted to ask you here. We don't hear anything about a serious attempted mediation. It's like it never get -- let me, and I'm not talking about sending Kamala Harris which we're going to talk about. That is not a serious attempt. OK?Where it's something where world leaders urgently meet with Putin and Zelenskyy and they figure out a way -- a face-saving, small victory for Putin because he can't afford to lose. He's already a war criminal which means if he loses, he's dead. So, they have to give them some kind of as Avril Haines said, she is the director of national intelligence said, you've got to give this guy proper deference because he feels that he never got that from the west or from Europe.So, we have to like somehow, you know, a nice little, small victory. A face-saving off-ramp. We need to have some kind of mediation, because to echo what Jesse said, what else can you -- what else can you do except world war? Right?PERINO: It's a great point and one thing Putin the mind is the downfall of Gaddafi and what happened to him and he sees that as something that it was a personal embarrassment to Gaddafi but absolute atrocity and he is determined to make sure that that never happens to him.And then yesterday we talked also about, do you ask the Chinese to help? Because is that the way? Because is that the only one?RIVERA: I think they are the only one.PERINO: They can talk to?GUTFELD: Xi and Biden go together.PERINO: Yes, when we have a block on China as well. So, Judge, obviously, we're looking at these images. So, this is the maternity hospital. The -- I mean, horrible.(CROSSTALK)JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS CO-HOST: My thoughts?PERINO: Yes. I don't even know what question to ask because I am speechless.(CROSSTALK)PIRRO: You know, I wonder what and Greg, I know what you're saying about, you know, mediation. Although, it reminds me, as a prosecutor, for many years people would blame the victim. And we would say it was the victim's fault that she was raped, her skirt was too short.Well, there was only one person at fault, and that's the rapist. And you know, when we talk about proper deference, you may -- you may believe he needs that, Putin needs that to save face. But when you are dealing with a man who is as wild as this man is, and I'm not going to say crazy because he's evil. Crazy is an excuse.The man is evil, he's attacking hospitals where women are giving birth. Women are no more vulnerable than they are when they are giving birth, I know. It is -- it is the most vulnerable. You are as vulnerable as you will ever be, when you are giving birth.But the idea that, you know, we've got to figure out a way to proper deference so we can work it out. Maybe we can. But he needs to be punished, he is a war criminal.GUTFELD: What do you suggest then?PIRRO: Let me just finish my thought. The problem is, you have to ask, what is the purpose of NATO? Is NATO supposed to pat cower when there is a bully out there? And when there is a bully who says, today, if you give them this, you are now triggering us. If you give them planes, you're going to trigger us. And if you give them, you know, if you get rid of oil, you may trigger us.He can change the rules every minute of the day. Do I have the answer? No, I don't have the answer, Greg. Maybe it's something where he wants eastern Ukraine and maybe that's the way it should happen. But my instincts, every fiber of my being says this man is an animal, he needs to be punished for the murders, for the decimation, for the 6-year-old who died of dehydration. For the lives that have been up ended because he wants power. I have a lot of problem with the mediation concept but maybe that's what we need internationally.GUTFELD: Well, if it's not that, then it's war.PERINO: But even today, Zelenskyy said --(CROSSTALK)PIRRO: Well, the people in Russia can get --PERINO: This would be creative, I don't know, I don't know if this would work, and we'll go in a second. But Zelenskyy said, I need to talk to Putin.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: Well, at this point he is the one who was rallying the world. Maybe he does need to talk to Putin.GUTFELD: Exactly.PERINO: I mean, is that worth a shot?GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: Perhaps it's worth a shot.GUTFELD: Kamala can get them together.PERINO: Is there a hash tag for that?GUTFELD: Yes.PIRRO: Yes.PERINO: All right, we'll talk about that. Millions of refugees are fleeing Ukraine and many are asking how to help. Well, you can help go to redcross.org/foxforward. Your donations will support their mission to provide aid and resources. Fox is doing its part. We are donating $1 million to help those who are suffering from this invasion.Up next on THE FIVE, Kamala Harris touching down in Europe after a major mixed-up over sending Ukraine fighter jets.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PIRRO: It's Vice President Kamala Harris to the rescue. The vice president arriving in Poland to smooth things over as controversy erupts over a plan to send fighter jets to Ukraine. Harris was originally headed to Europe to rally NATO allies, but mixed messaging from the White House is now taking center stage.After Secretary of State Blinken gave Poland the green light to send fighter jets to Ukraine, the administration was quick to strike down the plan. Now it's up to Vice President Kamala Harris to fix the mess. OK, so it's Kamala Harris to the rescue. Is she capable of comprehending the delicate foreign policy moment with the world consequences that she is entering into, Jesse?WATTERS: It's such a funny question. All right, it's insulting to send Kamala Harris at a time like this. She knows nothing about anything and we all know that, the Europeans know that, but who else are you going to send? So, she's going to get there and they're going to ask her about the MiGs, they are going to ask her about the no-fly zones. They are going to ask her about sanctions and things that she just doesn't grasp. And she's going to have to think and talk on the fly and it's not going to go well and it's going to bring great shame and embarrassment to the United States of America.I want to talk about something you guys were just talking about in terms of --(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: I totally disagree with that. But go ahead.WATTERS: OK, Geraldo. Wouldn't be the first time.RIVERA: Right.WATTERS: If you -- the other option is to just make this a proxy war. How long could that last? That could last years. That's --GUTFELD: You destroy Ukraine.WATTERS: Right.PIRRO: Yes.WATTERS: You destroy Ukraine, you load these people up with weapons --PIRRO: I feel you.WATTERS: -- you turn into Vietnam.(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: Like Lebanon on steroids.WATTERS: I mean, how long we're in Vietnam? Right?PIRRO: Yes.WATTERS: And so that's the third option. And that's the option that the U.S. and the western allies are pursuing. A proxy war. So that's not ending anytime soon.PIRRO: All right. But Geraldo, I want you to listen to Admiral Kirby talking about this mix-up with the MiGs and the misunderstanding.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN KIRBY, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: We do not support the transfer of additional fighter aircraft to the Ukrainian air force at this time and therefore have no desire to see them in our custody either. We believe the best way to support Ukrainian defense is by providing them the weapons and the systems that they need most to defeat Russian aggression. In particular, antiarmor and air defense.(END VIDEO CLIP)PIRRO: Your response?RIVERA: Well, I want America to stop telling the truth in these press conferences. I don't -- I don't think it gains anything to give full disclosure to the world about every step we are taking vis-a-vis the MiGs or any other sensitive topic.I think Admiral Kirby is a great guy, I've known him for a long time, I was in Haiti with him in the earthquake of 2010. But for him to go down the list about the aircraft and so forth. I want those MiGs delivered by any means necessary. And I don't care if they have to FedEx.In terms of Vice President Harris, though, this is the biggest day of her vice presidency. This is the most Herculean task she's ever been assigned. It's time now for her to shake off the mantle of ineffectiveness and really put her tushy on the line. I want her to disappear tonight.I don't want her to go with the Pols and the Hungarian -- I want her to disappear and I want her to go into Ukraine. Into western Ukraine. So far, it's safe. So far you don't have any, you know, assassination squads or so forth. You see the pictures of Lviv, maybe she doesn't have to go that far.I think it would be so symbolically powerful for the vice president of the United States to go into the beleaguered country, visit with those refugees and see the mamas and see the babies, and you know, what do you need, what can America do? Poor thing, I'm so sorry, we'll get these bastards. I want her to step up to this historic moment and not be the border czar and the other ridiculous job.PIRRO: OK. All right. Can she be, Dana, can she be successful at doing anything like that? Or, how about reassuring our allies?PERINO: Look, I mean, it would be great if so. So, let's see. She just arrived. She hasn't spoken yet. But I think another thing is, she could set up for a disaster once again because on the border thing, that ended up because she was asked, when are you going to the border? She laughed about it. They said, OK, we're going to put you in charge of the border. She says, OK, but I'm just going to talk about the root causes with just these three countries and actually I was never seen or heard from again on the border.So now you have a situation where earlier this week, I know it is only Wednesday but on Monday, we asked Admiral Kirby on America's Newsroom, there are reports that there are holdups at the White House in getting these MiGs out. He says no, no, no, no hold up, everything is fine.That afternoon is when Poland said, hey, guess what, surprise, we are going to send you the planes and then you are going to send them. And the Americans were like, wait, that is not going to happen. I'm pretty sure that Kamala Harris was supposed to go today so that she could say, isn't it great we got this all worked out? Poland sending the planes.And instead, because they were dragging their feet at the White House, this is just speculation on my part but it's pretty good speculation I would say, they're dragging their feet at the White House, now she's going there and she got a public dispute.This is what I would ask. What kind of diplomacy do we have, what kind of teamwork is it where you have a dispute like this that spills out into the public, to Geraldo's point, that this is not a discussion we should be having with the world about like how this all went down? But I think it was because the Pols tried to force the White House's hand on it, and now she has to go over there and try to clean it up. I don't know if it can be.PIRRO: Yes, go ahead, Greg.GUTFELD: Yes. I wonder how her laugh translates in Polish.RIVERA: That's mean.GUTFELD: It is mean and I'm going to get meaner. She is supposed to be delivering a three-part message.PIRRO: That's right.GUTFELD: Do you hear that three-part. It's like a book report I imagine. Part one is the intro, part two is root causes and part three is the index. Right? This is pure -- this is the first time I've seen virtue signaling as foreign policy. Right? They were just sending her there to send her there and it replaces an actual real progress or action.That's the problem with virtue signaling in general. People go on Twitter they type something and instead of actually doing something. So, this is exactly like that. It goes back to the crazy idea of mediation. Why not do something an audacious diplomatic act where you send people an actual grant of substance. Two American president, Obama and Bush or Obama and Trump.PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: What a road picture that would be.PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: And they go and they meet with these two guys and that -- and what that does is it soft some issues, you might get a ceasefire out of it, you give the proper deference, even to the madman or the evil man and you might actually get somewhere.This is just, I think it was you, it's kind of a slap in the face. You are sending the least qualified --WATTERS: Right.GUTFELD: -- vice president --WATTERS: Ever.GUTFELD: -- ever to do something in the first ground war that we've seen in Europe in decades, and this is what -- this is how we respond. This is pure virtue signaling, meaning it's entirely worthless.WATTERS: I just think we should get Obama and Trump on the same plane together --GUTFELD: Yes.WATTERS: -- just to do that.GUTFELD: Yes, yes. This is the wackiest idea I've ever come up with.PERINO: Unity.PIRRO: But you know what, Trump would fly his own plane I can tell you.WATTERS: Barack wants a lift.PIRRO: All right.RIVERA: Maybe Trump would fly a MiG-29.GUTFELD: Who says he hasn't.PIRRO: Ahead, President Biden says don't blame him for surging gas prices but the facts say otherwise.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNKNOWN: Mr. President, do you have a message for the American people on gas prices?JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: They're going to go up.UNKNOWN: What can you do about it?BIDEN: Can't do much right now. Russia is responsible.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Man.WATTERS: President Biden saying don't blame him for the record high cost of gas which is now $4.25 a gallon. The White House even coming up with a cute little hash tag, Putin price hike like that's actually going to make a difference.Joe Biden insisting the surge is all Putin's fault but take a look at this. Prices they've been skyrocketing ever since Biden took office after he promise to eliminate fossil fuels. And while everyday Americans are getting crushed at the pump the media and the Democrats they're just dismissing concerns and pushing green.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEPHEN COLBERT, COMEDIAN: Today the average gas price in America hit an all-time record high of over $4 per gallon. I'm willing to pay $4 a gallon, hell, I'll pay $15 a gallon because I drive a Tesla.UNKNOWN: Perhaps if you let the market work in this respect people will feel pain, we'll take a second look at that Ford F450 Gigantic truck. They'll reconsider at Tesla. You'll see high breed innovation.UNKNOWN: We should ultimately learn a lesson here and become energy independent and choose to invest in clean domestic energy.JENNIFER GRANHOLM, U.S. SECRETARY OF ENERGY: We have to move to clean energy solutions. Clean is in the end where she should be so that we don't find ourselves in this position again.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Geraldo Rivera --RIVERA: Aye, aye.WATTERS: -- so Joe Biden has said so many things about this. First, he said that it was COVID's fault and then he said supply chain, and then he said there was nothing he could do about the price of gas. And then he said he was doing everything to reduce the price of gas, and now he is saying I can't do anything again about the price of gas and it's just going to go up.RIVERA: Well, I personally don't think the president of the United States has a big role in setting the price of energy.WATTERS: So why is he even trying to do anything?RIVERA: Because politicians can't resist the temptation to say, I can fix this or that it's not my fault. But I believe you have to look at Wall Street, you have to look at the oil traders, you have to look at the guys who make money dealing it. At these prices, I'm going to go out and drill oil, everybody is going to go, this is --(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: You know what, go.RIVERA: -- this is fortune.WATTERS: Go, Geraldo. Go drill.RIVERA: This is a fortune could be made here. It's one thing when oil was $30 a barrel. Now it's $200 --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: But they have to let them do it. They have to let them do it.RIVERA: Well, I think that they -- there's plenty of leeway. And I think a lot -- I go back to the Permian Basin which I know Midland-Odessa --you know, that there's so much oil there. There's so many rigs where the last time I was there with a buddy at the campus of the University of Texas.There's so many rigs that are just sitting there. They're not using them because the market didn't demand it. Now, the market is demanding it. Now, if they can make a buck, it's all about -- it's all about money. Forget about politics. It's all about money.WATTERS: Is it all about money or is it about supply?PIRRO: It's all about the fact that this administration has no strategy. All they do is react. They have no plan. They never had a plan. All they can do is blame Russia or blame Trump or blame somebody else.The truth is that, Geraldo, if these prices have been going up since Joe Biden came in, we were energy independent, all was well, the price of gas - - and we've been over this a million times, the price of gas was affordable. And then he comes in and he's got this green energy of policy. And even the guy who said, you shouldn't be driving that big black truck, you should be -- reconsider a Tesla, the guy who builds Tesla and says drill baby drill, OK.And in the end, you know, what we've got -- or we've got -- it's not just - - it's not just the Keystone, which is really the pipeline that can bring the oil down, it's about the fact that everything in this administration doesn't allow for drilling. It's slow-walking permits, it's slow-walking all of the policies in the right of ways and the roads to the lease, and the supply and labor shortages. There was no planning. That's why we're in this mess.WATTERS: And Greg, now, the president called the Saudis. The Saudis wouldn't pick up the phone, wouldn't take his call.GUTFELD: Wow. There you go.WATTERS: It happened to you before. It happens a lot. No one takes your calls.GUTFELD: When I tried to get reservations for you at the restaurant.WATTERS: I actually got in.GUTFELD: Oh, you did?WATTERS: I did. Yes. It was a mistake though.GUTFELD: Applebee's loves you. This does --RIVERA: Olive Garden.GUTFELD: Yes. This exposes a flaw in the most left-wing ideas which is that they have a goal which is a green -- 100 percent green environment, but they don't have a system to get there. So, it leaves us in a quandary when they cut -- when they remove the solution which is drilling because they have no real replacement. So, you end up going after dictators' oil instead of our own.And once again, the hashtag replaces real action. They probably worked in that alliterative Putin hashtag for months, but you get -- you get the feeling that Psaki and from that montage -- this is an ideology of punishment, right? They see the American people as an amorphous blob with no real life or feeling. You know, too bad they don't have a cool job where you never have to pump gas like Jen Psaki. You know, it's like I pump gas - - I pump my own gas up, believe it or not.RIVERA: everybody that doesn't live in New Jersey pumps their own gas.GUTFELD: Exactly.PERINO: I love it that in New Jersey you don't have to pump your own gas.GUTFELD: I enjoy too, the gas. I love the smell.RIVERA: Me too.PIRRO: Yes, diesel too.RIVERA: I love -- I love tipping the gas.WATTERS: All right, so --RIVERA: Can I say one thing about Saudi Arabia?WATTERS: Yes, please.RIVERA: Saudi Arabia is a miserable country. I mean --GUTFELD: That was necessarily.RIVERA: No, no. Saudi Arabia is killing civilians in Yemen -- going back to what I said earlier about my moral failings and not represent -- you know, feeling sorry for the people in Aleppo when they were getting bombed. Saudi Arabia is bombing the hell out of Yemen. They're killing civilians right and left and the world is silent on it because we want Saudi oil. It's pathetic.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: Well, we don't actually need Saudi oil. We can just use American oil. We can totally delink ourselves if we wanted to from global oil prices and we could have American prices dominant.PERINO: I think that we should just ask we ourselves should pump and we should ask all of our allies to do it because the global economy is going to need fuel in order to keep going. So, we should do everything we can here but let's get everyone else to do it as well. Let's talk about nuclear, all that.On the hashtag thing, the stupid thing about that is Twitter doesn't even use hashtags anymore. Because they remove the hashtag and they just like pick up on keywords. So, you don't actually need the hashtag.GUTFELD: You know what?PERINO: Like they did in bring back our girl.GUTFELD: This is the -- oh yes, this is the first I've heard of this.PERINO: Yes. So, you know -- so, hashtag -- no need to have our hashtag.GUTFELD: That's what we should be covering.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Dana's -- that's \"ONE MORE THING.\"GUTFELD: That would be our E block.PERINO: That's like -- I mean, that's the news you need to know. But the other thing I wanted to mention is OK, so they want you to buy electric vehicles. OK, well, electric vehicles require a battery. One of the things you need to make the battery is nickel. Where do we get nickel? Oh, Russia. And where are the nickel mines being held up? Oh, America. So, you see the pattern that we're seeing here, hashtag pattern.WATTERS: It is funny to watch someone in a very nice outfit sit back and just say hey, you know, just go buy a Tesla company. Go buy an EV. Like that -- like it's that easy.PIRRO: And what about the lithium batteries?WATTERS: It's true.PIRRO: From China.WATTERS: Exactly. All right, I'll be at Applebee's in about an hour. Coming up, Communist China is set to rescue Russia from financial ruin.RIVERA: What would you order?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)RIVERA: Communist China reportedly getting ready to bail out Vladimir Putin. The U.S. and NATO Allies hitting Russia right where it hurts as you know with these harsh sanctions and the banning of Russian blood oil. The Kremlin vowing to fight back saying America has declared an all-out economic war. But then, Russia turns to China and China could be tossing Putin a financial life preserver considering they are, we are told, buying stakes in Russia's energy sector.So, China will just, you know, take up the slack for Russia.PIRRO: Absolutely. I mean, these two guys think alike. Of course, they're going to take care of each other. And you know what's amazing?RIVERA: But are you surprised that they're friends?PIRRO: I'm not surprised at all. And when he says it's an all-out economic war, Putin, it goes right back to what I was saying and I think it was in the A block when he's talking about the fact that who knows what new hurdler what new standard he's going to use for, you know, triggering him? It's an economic war, so therefore, I'm going to be at war with all of you.But no, I think that -- I think they should be very happy together. But the problem is that if we go to electric vehicles and all that, we're going to have some trouble with lithium and some of the other materials that we need.RIVERA: See, I go back to the money thing, Jesse. I think China wants to make money. China is in -- exists to make money and to get more and more powerful. This is very bad for business.WATTERS: It is --RIVERA: You know, Europe in turmoil and everybody suspicious of the other.WATTERS: Yes. It is bad for business. But they're going to go in and raid all the commodities out of Russia. They're going to go after their timber and their coal and their oil and their gas. But after commodities, they don't have anything in Russia. And then there -- you look at China -- you look at China and you look at Russia and you think that's disgusting. You don't want to have any association with Russia. And then you're going to have some guy come in, the Chinese, and an act like their sugar daddy, no.So, they're going to face boycotts, they're going to face sanctions. If you're going to come in and deal with the Russians, then you're going to have Western banking institutions say no, you stay over there. So, they're going to have to decide, you know, are they going to delink themselves from the global economy and deal deals with a pariah state that's going bankrupt? Or do they want to, you know, keep propping up their economy with Western cash, and at least try to be seen as a normal stakeholder and not some disgusting, you know, communist regime that's bailing out a war criminal?RIVERA: What about Taiwan, Dana? What about -- here you have this island. China threatening to take it over the way they took over Hong Kong. But militarily, they want to take over Taiwan. Will this give China the feeling that America is a toothless tiger anyway, that now is the time to take Taiwan?PERINO: Well, it is interesting that President Xi has this opportunity to see how it would go. So, he told Putin to wait until after the Olympics, which tells me also, Xi doesn't think of Putin as an equal at all. He thinks of Putin as subpar. And I think he also thinks that this was pitiful the way that this has gone down, and that it looks awful.And we even heard yesterday that the Germans and the French were talking to the Chinese about figuring out a way to try to find peace talks. I think -- I think that the Chinese look at Putin and think like, if it had gone perfectly according to all the things that Greg mentioned, all the assumption, the four assumptions that Putin had, that all of that had worked out perfectly, I think Beijing would have said, well, then next fall, after our big communist meeting, maybe we just go ahead and figure out a way to take Taiwan. That might have gotten harder now.But one of the things that China will figure out in addition to the economic things that you've mentioned, is that the oil will be available to them to buy. They have a voracious appetite. And they've been helping Iran for many years get out of the situation with the sanctions for the rest of the world. China doesn't care, they'll buy their oil.So, there might be a way for Putin to at least keep afloat in some way. But I agree that's not a very attractive dance partner that China is looking at here.RIVERA: And yet, Greg, when you look at the map, if you ever map at home, folks, take a look at China and Russia together. They take -- they take up an awful lot big hunk of the world.GUTFELD: Well, you know what, this is what -- I hope -- I hope Dana is right. But it's not just the world, it's the final frontier. I don't want a partnership between China and Russia because they're going to need to be partners if we're talking about space or owning that space, because basically, that should be ours. But if those two guys get together, we're screwed.But you're right. You know, if Russia does end up hooking up with China, they have to be China's puppet.PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: How can it be anything else? Because you -- if they have all your bank -- they have all your bank stuff, right? Because you're going to do the bank stuff, they're going to buy your oil, like what can Putin do. Putin is basically going to be holding his jock.RIVERA: They also have 10 times the population of Russia.PERINO: That's exactly what I was going to say.GUTFELD: I said holding his jock. I don't even know what that means.PERINO: Yes, you took the words right out of my mouth.GUTFELD: Sorry about that.PERINO: The other issue is the Arctic Circle --GUTFELD: Yes.RIVERA: That's an ugly --PERINO: -- where there's a lot of oil and there will be a dispute. I'm fascinated by that talk.RIVERA: The jock talk is an ugly visual. Coming up, a terrifying warning on what a frustrated Vladimir Putin could do next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: U.S. intelligence officials warning Vladimir Putin is growing angry and frustrated as the Ukrainian resistance holds up. Russia losing about 50 military vehicles a day including tanks. And now American intelligence thinks Putin could use drastic measures if he can't take Ukraine.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAM BURNS, DIRECTOR, CIA: Russian doctrine holds that, you know, escalate to deescalate. Russian leadership considering the use of tactical nuclear weapons. But I stressed that that's only in that specific circumstance that you described, a direct military conflict between NATO and Russia.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: And the White House now warning that Russia could use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine. Do you think he would do that, Dana? I think he would lose just about any --PERINO: Any support.GUTFELD: Any support or any argument against taking him out as, you know, other countries.PERINO: You made some good points in the A book about how he will be desperate.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: And so, I don't think that we do know. And I think William Burns, the CIA director is probably the most competent and valuable member of the President's cabinet, and that maybe he should have gone to Poland. And I think that the reason -- you know, he said is very specific, right? It's like, if this happens, and only this happens, and he's answering a question from a member of Congress. He's not saying this is going to happen, Putin is about to do this.And so, I think that we have to maybe be cautious, be aware that it is a possibility, but not worry too much at the moment.GUTFELD: What do you think, Judge?PIRRO: You know what's interesting as I'm looking at this? The top U.S. intelligence agency offered a sobering assessment of him in how his invasion into Ukraine can affect the safety and security of the United States. And although we're really not in this war, we are not, is he going to react because he's losing so badly?And he is losing badly on the world stage and he is being condemned every day. I mean there isn't a human being alive that I know of who isn't opposed to what's going on with, you know, a medical building and hospitals being bombed, civilians being killed, people's lives being upended. And if you are as desperate as Putin is to either impress Xi Jinping or, you know, to expand his own territory, then he's going to resort to what he resorted to in Aleppo and in Chechnya.I mean, I can imagine him doing that. Then the question is, what do we do? Where -- when do we get triggered? We keep worrying about triggering him. He's going to trigger himself.GUTFELD: You know, Geraldo, there is a lesson here is that -- I mean, a good lesson and that if you invade a neighbor, the world will destroy your country. I mean, I think that's a fairly new thing. I mean, what we're seeing is such a speedy kind of dramatic response.RIVERA: You listed the failures of Putin. And one of the failures was his inability to foresee that Germany and France would shake off the doldrums and get it together and back the assailed country, the beleaguered country, Ukraine.But that's not what I'm worried about. You know, that's what's happening now. What I worry about is the guy facing abject defeat and disappointment and rebellion within his ranks and all those dead bodies coming home, all those kids all those draftees coming home dead, you know. And, you know, he's looking at his butler, waiting for his butler to kill him. Doing a nuke -- a nuke is the thing that -- that's the nightmare.When you're at my age, that's where you grew up in the Cold War. This is the Cold War II. What's this crazy nutjob going to do when he's in the corner? He's like -- he's like a rat. He's like a rat -- cornered rat. What's he going to do? If he -- if he -- there's no doubt that if Hitler had a button at the end of World War II, and he knew -- and the Russians were coming into Berlin, he would have pushed the button and nuke the world, destroyed the world. There's no doubt about that in my mind.And I think about Putin now. Is he -- is he going to have the button at the end of the world?GUTFELD: I hope they gave him a fake button. That would be nice.WATTERS: Greg, you know, you should be CIA director.GUTFELD: I know.WATTERS: Maybe that would --GUTFELD: I just came up with that on the fly. Give him a fake button.RIVERA: It's a great idea.WATTERS: Maybe that was the button Hillary gave. Remember?RIVERA: That's right. The reset button.PIRRO: Yes, the reset.WATTERS: So, if he is that crazy when he's in a corner, and he's that desperate to use a tactical nuke, we can't put him in the corner.GUTFELD: Right.WATTERS: That's why when NATO gets involved, that's when the tactical nuke comes out. We -- that's why I think the likelihood of a coup --RIVERA: That's a good point.WATTERS: -- rises when NATO doesn't get involved. Because the minute the situation where NATO gets involved, then that galvanizes Russia, then Russia sees oh, NATO is involved and the Kremlin gets all fired up and it becomes Russia versus NATO.Now, Putin owns this. He owns the Russian economy. He went in. He's destroyed the ruble. Leave it that way. Make him own this. And that's where you want to dance. That's the place you want to dance.PIRRO: But he's not going to own it by himself quietly. That's the thing.WATTERS: Well, right, because he's got all the misinformation.PIRRO: You're talking about totally defeating him.WATTERS: But I think if no one buys Russian oil, and the ruble is worthless --PIRRO: Chinese are going to buy the Russian oil.WATTERS: Well, the pipelines don't go to China. They got to ship it. And you can't even get insurance to ship anything now. It can take forever to get it to Beijing. But I don't know. I think, wait it out a little bit longer. Let the sanctions really, really bite harder and just see what happens.PERINO: And pray.WATTERS: And pray.PERINO: Pray for miracles because --RIVERA: Right.PERINO: -- that's what I think that -- you look, for the miracles. There have been a few. And the really brave, heroic things that are being done and other countries to help the refugees, but find a humanitarian corridor, find a way to help -- get a country that can provide actual humanitarian corridor that is safe.That should be our number one goal overnight. That's what -- that's what -- not Hillary, Kamala Harris should focus on tonight.GUTFELD: Yes. There has to be a way to let Putin's inner circle or outer circle know that they are also can be tried for war crimes, because that's a great incentive for them because they still -- they might live and they might live to see their own execution.WATTERS: This was a big day with the bombing of the -- this was a crucial day for the -- for Russia and the West.PIRRO: Yes, turning point.RIVERA: I hope you're right. I hope you're right.GUTFELD: All right, more breaking news from Ukraine next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: President Zelenskyy says millions of people could die if the world does not act now to stop Russian bombings. That happening after a horrific airstrike on a children's hospital today. Let's get to our final thoughts before we turn it over to Bret. Greg.GUTFELD: Yes, just to reiterate what I said at the beginning of the show. The options are we go in or we mediate, you know. And I think that we spent -- we spent a lot of time -- we had a lot of powerful politicians in the Ukraine in 2014 and Biden even claimed that he spent more time on the phone with Ukrainian leaders and his own wife. So, if we can meddle, we can mediate. I say we go -- you know, we create a, you know, and A team of sorts.PERINO: Jesse?GUTFELD: Including Jesse.WATTERS: I'm on an A team?GUTFELD: Yes, first time.WATTERS: They wouldn't have me on that team. I think that oil prices are going to probably hit 200. And gas prices are going to probably hit six or $7.00 a gallon here in the United States and the President is going to have to make a serious decision and he's not there yet, but he will have to make that decision.PERINO: We'll get there. Geraldo?RIVERA: I said yesterday that Zelenskyy could not be killed. Now, his image, his heroism will live forever in the annals of Ukrainian history. But I also think that Putin, by murdering women and children, has gone beyond the pale. He is irredeemable. You can't think of a world with Putin anymore.PERINO: Judge Jeanine.PERINO: And you know, I think that in Russia also, I mean, given what he has done to his own people and the fact that many of his own people don't agree with what he's doing, I think that Putin is the persona non grata of the century.PERINO: Perhaps forever. All right, that is it for us. \"SPECIAL REPORT\" is up next. Hi, Bret!Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2022 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
